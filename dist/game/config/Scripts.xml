	With this file you can exclude/include specific folders/files from within the scripts directory.
	
	In order to exclude a folder/file simply add the following line:
	<exclude file="{FOLDER/FILE NAME HERE}" />
	For example to exclude the quests directory, use:
	<exclude file="quests" />
	
	If you want to exclude all files within a directory except certain file(s), you can do it like so:
	<exclude file="{FOLDER NAME HERE}">
		<include file="{FOLDER/FILE NAME HERE}" />
		<include file="{FOLDER/FILE NAME HERE}" />
		...
	</exclude>
	For example to exclude ForgeOfTheGods folder except Valakas script, use:
	<exclude file="ForgeOfTheGods">
		<include file="Valakas.java" />
	</exclude>
