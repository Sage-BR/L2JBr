The crystal is special, so even if it breaks, you can make a crystal with the shards. Once the crystal is made, it will gain back its power, so as long as we get the shards, we can save the Princess by taking out all the cold energy from her.<br>
The problem is that the crystal shards are scattered around the Labyrinth... I can't leave this place, since I have to watch over the Princess. Do you think you can help? I can send you to the Labyrinth to collect the Ice Crystal Shards.<br>
Please keep in mind that I can't send all of you at once. Come to me one by one, and I'll send you.<br>
