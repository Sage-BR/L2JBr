Different from the Training Dummies?<br>
Take these <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots</font>. They have no grade, but as you get stronger and get better weapons, you can use Grade D, C, B, A, S, S-80, and eventually R. It's very important in the Material Realm.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Activate Soulshots</font>.<br>
I will prepare the next set of monsters. Tell me when you have activated the Soulshots.<br>
(How to Enable Auto-Use Soulshot or Spiritshot: Open your <font color="LEVEL">Inventory</font>. <font color="LEVEL">Click and Drag</font> Soulshot/Spiritshot into your Shortcut Bar. Right Click the Soulshot/Spiritshot Shortcut Icon to use it automatically.)
