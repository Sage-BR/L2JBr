<html><body>Dimensional Researcher Piore:<br>
I can't believe you actually defeated Makkum. I am the Dimensional Researcher Piore, studying the Dimensional Rift together with Lias.<br>
While we have confirmed that Makkum is here, he is not an easy opponent, and we were looking for the right opportunity. Iy's quite a feat foe you to defeat Makkum so soon. I'd like to express the gratitude of the Dimensional Researchers.<br>
I need to explore the Dimensional rift a bit more. If it's alright with you, could you go to Lias and tell her about the situation? I will send you to where Lias is.<br>
