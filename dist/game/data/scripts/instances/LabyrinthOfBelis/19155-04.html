We reached the final room! Excellent!<br>
This will be the most difficult challenge, and will test us both to our limits.<br>
There is a powerful current flowing through this room, which you cannot pass. I can, but only with special equipment, and even then, I can only last a little while.<br>
I want you to watch over me while I destroy the circuit breaker, ok? As soon as I start, enemies will come pouring in, so keep them off me!<br>
Ready?<br>
