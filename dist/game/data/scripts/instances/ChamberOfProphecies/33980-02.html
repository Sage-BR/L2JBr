Mysterious Wizard:<br>
This is a extremely rare gem called <font color="LEVEL">Atelia</font>. To my knowledge, it's only found in the Wind Spirit Realm.<br>
I heard that an Atelia can recognize its owner. You see how it turned back to its original form when you touched it? That means you are the rightful owner.<br>
