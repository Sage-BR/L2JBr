I see you're a quick study. I'm impressed. I can't wait to see how much you'll have improved in the future. You have recovered some of your power that has been sealed while passing through the Dimensional Rift. These are called <font color="LEVEL">Skills</font>.<br>
The more abilities you recover, the stronger you'll grow.<br>
Now that you've recovered some of your power, shall we face tougher enemies? Are you ready?<br>
