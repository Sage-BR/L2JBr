You're better than I expected. Feels different from training with a dummy, right?<br>
Here, take these <font color="LEVEL">Spiritshots</font>. Right now, your weapon has no grade, but as you become stronger, you'll be using D-grade, C-grade, and even R-grade weapons. They're proving to be very valuable in the Material Realm.<br>
Go ahead and <font color="LEVEL">activate the Spiritshots</font>.<br>
I'll go prepare more monsters for your next training session, so let me know when the Spiritshots have been activated.<br>
(You can conveniently automate your Spiritshots by creating a <font color="LEVEL">shortcut</font> and then <font color="LEVEL">right-clicking</font> on it.)
