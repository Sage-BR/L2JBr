Who is it? Ah, it's you! You've come this far!<br> 
The last altar is before you.<br>
After Embryos invaded the Keucereus Alliance Base, the existence of the Messiah Castle was revealed. Melisa and Isadora, the twin sisters who had long disappeared, returned and are threatening us. If we fail to stop the ritual, Embryos will invade Aden Continent in no time. We must stop them at all cost.<br>
My man Dinford will be waiting for you at the entrance to the last altar. Go to find him.<br>
