<html><body>Royal Guard Captain Logart Van Dyke:<br>
How did you get in here? The blockade was only recently lifted, and this area is still very dangerous. It is under the control of the Kingdom's Royal Guard.<br>
It is suspected that Embryos are preparing somewhere in this area to invade the Aden Continent. The Kingdom's Royal Guard is doing its best to stop them. are you here to stop the Embryo's ritual on the Altar of Shilen? if so. I'll gladly open open this door. Be careful. Only danger awaits you.<br>
