Here's the plan. You weaken Istina as much as you can, while I prepare the magical Ballista. Have you seen one of those? They're rather impressive. They are powered by soulshots and can do a great deal of damage. Their main drawback is that they require a lot of energy to recharge, so please tell your team to push yourselves to collect as much magical power as you can, as quickly as possible.<br>
That is all the advice I can give; the rest of it is up to you.<br>
Oh, I once gave you an <font color="LEVEL">Energy Control Device</font>, didn't I? You will most certainly need it for your fight with Istina, so shall I give it to you now?<br>
