Are you really ready, physically and mentally? Do not underestimate Istina's power, especially here on her home turf.<br>
If you still believe you have a chance, we will help you by weakening Istina with the magical power Ballista.<br>
Istina's creative power is generated by the soul stone in her body. Regular attacks won't even scratch the soul stone, but by concentrating your magical power into a huge attack with the Ballista, we can damage her. I will give you more details once you are inside the cavern. Are you ready to enter now?<br>
Also, do you have the <font color="LEVEL">Energy Control Device</font>? You will need it for this fight.<br><br>
By the way, I can exchange Istina's Accessories for something better for you. But keep in mind that the enchantment in the accessories will be reset.<br>
