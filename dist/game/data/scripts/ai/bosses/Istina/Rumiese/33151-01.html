For quite some time, we've been wondering how to counter Istina's mysterious Spirit Energy. We've found a device that can exert some slight control over the Spirit Energy. Istina will summon the <font color="LEVEL">Sealing Energy</font>, and that will bind one target. When that happens, you can use the <font color="LEVEL">Energy Control Device</font> to unbind the target. However, the Energy Control Device will need some time to recharge after each use, so be sure to save it for when your need is great.<br>
Also, when Istina goes into her frenzy, the power of one person alone will not stop her; you'll need at least five people using the Energy Control Device at that point.<br>
