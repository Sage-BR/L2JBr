Currently the magic power of Sailren and its followers is very strong. I do not think you can win solely with your own power, especially given how weak the seal stones have become.<br>
My counsel is that you first recover the power to seal and wait 'til Sailren's strength lessens a bit. Then you will have your best chance of entering the nest and defeating this ancient evil.<br>
