We tracked down Kimerian only to find him deranged and very, very dangerous!<br>
Please, you must stop him before the Magmeld Fairies are gone forever! We want to help, too, and will send the bravest of the warrior fairies, Naomi Kasheron, to fight alongside you.<br>
This is <font color="LEVEL">Glimmer</font>, which you need to use when the fairies that are helping you become weak and defenseless. The <font color="LEVEL">Glimmer</font> will be very useful.<br>
You should also remember to use the <font color="LEVEL">Fairy's Leaf Flute</font>, if you have it! Its melodies will attract other fairies to fight alongside you!<br>
