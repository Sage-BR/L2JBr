Airship, eh? If you want board an Airship, you need to first register for a Summon License. There's a switch on the Airship controls that proves your qualifications to summon and pilot it. Unless you obtain that license, you won't be allowed to fly.<br>
Only <font color="LEVEL">Clan Leaders whose clan is level 5 or above</font> may earn the license. There is also a limit on the number of Airships.<br>
If you meet the requirements, you can obtain a Airship Summon License in exchange for <font color="LEVEL">10 Energy Star Stones</font>.<br>
An Energy Star Stone can be made by assembling Star Stones found floating in the skies over Gracia. If you think this is too time-consuming, you can also buy them from Officer Tolonis right over there..<br>
