<html><body>Large Cocoon:<br>
You can see... many fairy citizens are being changed within these... cocoons,<br>
but it's not too late... to stop them! Attack the cocoons, while they are still forming, and you will destroy them.<br>
Otherwise, you can promote the mutation by injecting <font color="LEVEL">Glimmer</font> into them channel where nutrients are supplied.<br><br>
(To use <font color="LEVEL">Glimmer</font>, target a cocoon and click Glimmer. To attack the cocoon, initiate an attack while pressing the Ctrl key. For a powerful attack, use your skills.)<br>
