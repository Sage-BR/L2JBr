Greetings friend, my name is Acateo.<br>
Pray tell, have you heard of the Academy? Please, Allow me to educate you on what we have to offer.<br>
First, characters who join the Academy receive an additional 10% XP until they graduate. Second, if you use the mentoring system while in the Academy, the number of Mentee Marks given to the mentee increases. Lastly, when academy members of level 40 or above level up, they receive additional clan fame points.<br>
Someone of your stature must appreciate what the Academy has to offer.<br>
Spread the word and direct anyone who wishes to join to me. Each person who joins the Academy receives a welcoming gift of Academy Circlets.<br>
