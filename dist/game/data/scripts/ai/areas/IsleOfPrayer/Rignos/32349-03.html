You have 30 minutes to find three other structures just like the one behind me. They are scattered around the island. Once you find them, go inside and battle the opponents you find there. One of these combatants will drop a Race Stamp. Bring 4 Race Stamps to me within the allotted time, and I will give you a reward that will aid you in your endeavor to rescue Parme.<br>
Don't forget to include the building behind me!<br>
