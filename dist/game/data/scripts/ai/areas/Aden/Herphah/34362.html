I traveled around the continent and decided to stay here for a while... Then, I saw you! What fate!<br>
If you are wandering without knowing what to do, I can help you. How about starting the <font color="LEVEL">Way of Wandering Knight </font>? 
I also recommend visiting the Adventure Guild, which has many missions appropriate for you.<br>
I'm now working with the <font color="LEVEL">Adventure Guild </font>so you can trust them.<br>
Let me know if you need any advice.<br>
