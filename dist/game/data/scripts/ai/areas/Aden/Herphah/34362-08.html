From levels 97 to 99... You should start to find appropriate zones on your own. I'd like to recommend three zones.<br>
The first is the <font color="LEVEL">Cemetery</font>. It is the closest one of the three. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Seal of Shilen</font> through the gatekeeper here, and find the <font color="LEVEL">Aden Vanguard Quartermaster</font>. He will give you missions related with <font color="LEVEL">the Fallen King's Men</font>.<br>
The second is the <font color="LEVEL">Blazing Swamp</font>. It is not far from here. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Blazing Swamp</font> through the gatekeeper and find a little unusual orc. Ask the orc about the quest <font color="LEVEL">Waiting for Pa'agrio</font>. Oh, don't worry. Some orcs are quite friendly.<br>
The last is the <font color="LEVEL">Pagan Temple</font>. To get there, you should first go to the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Rune</font> through the gatekeeper. Find <font color="LEVEL">Priestess of Light Razen</font> inside the Pagan Temple and ask him about <font color="LEVEL">Triol's Movement</font>. He will tell you what to do.<br>
