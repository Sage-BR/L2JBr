Hmm... Zones recommended for level 85 or lower?<br>
The question is too broad. Aden is vast and has many hunting zones. But it's really hard to answer your question without knowing exactly what level is recommendable to you.<br>
Ah! Right. Did you read the <font color="LEVEL">letters</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Kekropus</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Queen Navari</font>?<br>
Some <font color="LEVEL">scrolls</font> must be regularly delivered to you. Worried that young adventurers grow fast but don't know what to do or what to aim for, Kekropus and Queen Navari have regularly sent you letters to tell where to go.<br>
If you haven't read them, go to the bottom right. You see some scrolls. They are the letters from Kekropus or Queen Navari.<br>
