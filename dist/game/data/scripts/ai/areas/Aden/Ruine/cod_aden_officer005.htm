<font color="LEVEL">The Dimensional Rift</font> was a phenomenon that was identified after the Dimensional Crack was discovered, during additional investigations of Aden Castle and the Ivory Tower. It all began when strange movement was detected in the sealed off Catacomb of the Witch.<br>
Monsters began appearing in the Catacomb of the Witch. We felt they were out of place, and got to thinking that they might have something to do with the various recent events that have to do with the dimension. We therefore participated in the survey as well.<br>
What we found was that as the Dimensional Crack grew, the Dimensional Rift which had existed previously had been growing. The Catacomb of the Witch has now been completely consumed by the Dimensional Rift. I don't know if this is a good or bad thing, but the Dimensional Rift has not expanded beyond the size of the Catacomb of the Witch. However, we could not leave the situation as it was, and thus we began our expedition of the Dimensional Rift.<br>
The Dimensional Rift is even more dangerous than then Dimensional Crack. You must be even more careful there.<br>
