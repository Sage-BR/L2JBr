<html><body>Dimension Seeker Ruine:<br>
Nice to meet you. I am Dimension Seeker Ruine.<br>
Many problems associated with the dimensions have been occurring nowadays. I have been asked by Aden Castle to investigate, and that is what brings me here.<br>
Among the various issues relating to the dimension, the issues that I am involved with are the <font color="LEVEL">Dimensional Crack</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Dimensional Rift</font>.<br>
If you would like, I will send you to the <font color="LEVEL">Dimensional Crack</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Dimensional Rift</font>. Please help me with searching the dimension.<br>
