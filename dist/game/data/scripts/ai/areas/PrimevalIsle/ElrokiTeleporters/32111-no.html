Oh ho -- you have sought me out while battling the dinosaurs, have you? And now you ask me to teleport you to that place? That island was created as as a sanctuary; it is my duty is to protect its inhabitants from external harm. I certainly have no intention of making that place a refuge for reckless adventurers! It is my policy not to teleport any who are engaged in battle, so return after the battle has ended.
