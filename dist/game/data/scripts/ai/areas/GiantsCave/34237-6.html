What effects does the Giant Pursuers Talisman have, you ask? You're quite the pragmatist, I see. Well, it's nothing difficult to tell you, so I will.<br>
We came to create the Giant TrPursuers Talisman while searching for a way to gain the advantage when taking on the Giants. If you wear the Giant Pursuers Talisman, we will be able to help you when you need to take on the Giants.<br>
Of course, it doesn't apply to all Giants. It'll be less than useless against such powerful beings as Mimir, Ramona, or Helios, but with the other run-of-the-mill giants, it should be quite potent.<br>
