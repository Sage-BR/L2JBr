I have heard from Kekropus that the Resistance Mark has been handed to those of you who have helped us here.<br>
However, the Giants have found out about the mark, and we can no longer guarantee the safety of those who hold it.<br>
Kekropus finds this situation regrettable. He has instructed us to take the Resistance Marks back from those who hold it, and offer a reward for their hard work. However, only those who hold <font color="LEVEL">Stage 2 or above Resistance Marks</font> are eligible to receive rewards.<br>
