So you'd like to know how talismans are made.<br>
If you want to make a Giant Pursuers Talisman, you'll need to collect the core materials. It'll also cost you.<br>
The core ingredients are the <font color="LEVEL">Giant Crystal</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Energy</font>. The <font color="LEVEL">Giant Crystal</font> is contained in the supply box that we have given you in exchange for your hep with our missions.<br>
Also, the performance of the talismans can be improved, but that will require additional materials. Be sure to check beforehand.<br>
If you want to make a talisman, prepare the materials necessary. Also be prepared to pay the cost.<br>
