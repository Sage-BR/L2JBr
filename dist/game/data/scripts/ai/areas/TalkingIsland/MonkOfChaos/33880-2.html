<html><body>Monk of Chaos:<br>
We, the Monks of Chaos, serve the balance.<br>
You may think chaos is a destructive force, but nothing could be further from the truth. <font color="LEVEL">Chaos</font> seeks to balance light and darkness by reverting them to the original energies.<br>
We who respect his will are the only ones truly free to act on it.<br>
