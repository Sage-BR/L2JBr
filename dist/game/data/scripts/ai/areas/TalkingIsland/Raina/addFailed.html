Sorry, but you're not qualified to add a subclass.<br1>
To add a new subclass, you need the following qualifications:<br>
First, <font color="LEVEL">you've completed the 'Red Thread of Fate' quest</font>. If you want to get on that, let me know.<br>
Second, <font color="LEVEL">your current class has done the 2nd class transfer, and all your subclass levels are 75 or higher</font>. For example, if your subclasses are Temple Knight and Silver Ranger, they must both be level 75 for you to add a third subclass.<br>
Third, you may only have <font color="LEVEL">up to 3 subclasses</font>, I'm afraid.<br>
Got it?
