<html><body>Subclass/Dual Class Master Raina:<br>
I heard that Ertheia are curious people. But a gem that absorbs power... I still can't help thinking that it's really dangerous. You could have died. <br>
But thanks to your efforts, even Ertheia can use the power of the giants now.<br>
But because you're different than the race from the Material Realm, your power will not merge with the giants'. Because they do not mingle, you will not be able to use your power while using the giants' power. Of course, you can use your original power instead of the giants' power anytime you wish.<br>
Now! Would you like to use the power of the giants?<br>
