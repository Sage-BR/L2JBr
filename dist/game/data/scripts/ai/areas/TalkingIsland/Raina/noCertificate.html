You need a Subclass Change Certificate in order to receive the power of the gods. This was given to heroes long before Shilen's destructive rampages came about, so you can't find new ones anymore.<br>
But if you have the certificate, talk to me again as a subclass ready to receive the power of the gods.<br>
