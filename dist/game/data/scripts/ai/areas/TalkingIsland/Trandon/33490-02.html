Dual class certification can be done when <font color="LEVEL">your main and dual class levels both hit 85, 90, 95, and 99</font>. You can get certificates by getting certified for each of them, and with the certificates, you get to learn skills.<br>
Remember; <font color="LEVEL">skills you learned through dual certification only apply to main class and dual class</font>.<br>
