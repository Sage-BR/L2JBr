<html><body>Subclass Skill Certification:<br>
You have already received the certificate for this occupation.<br>
I cannot give you any more certificates for your current occupation. If you wish to obtain another certificate, please come back as an occupation from another slot.<br>
However, Ertheia are still connected to gods. So it would be meaningless for them to start a new life as a subclass, which also means that subclass certificates are meaningless for them.<br>
(Ertheia cannot add a subclass or get a subclass certificate.)
