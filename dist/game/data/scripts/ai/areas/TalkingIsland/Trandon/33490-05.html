<html><body>Subclass/Dual Class Certificate Manager Trandon:<br>
Subclass skill certification and learning actually require tons of effort. Not just effort - it's more fundamental than that. The enormous pressure it puts on your soul... a normal person wouldn't be able to survive it.<br>
Not that it's completely impossible if you use special herbs. Except that those herbs cost about <font color="LEVEL">10 million Adena</font> each. But I have the herbs handy, so as long as you pay up, I can cancel that certification for you.<br>
If you cancel the certification, <font color="LEVEL">your current certification status disappears, and all the certificates and sealbooks you didn't learn skills with will be deleted</font>. So...what do you want to do?<br>
