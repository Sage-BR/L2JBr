<html><body>Ghost Chamberlain of Elmoreden:<br>
Woooo! I'm a ghost page of the ancient Elmoreden Empire! I worked in the cemetery when I was a mortal being. Now I'm here to help travelers going to the Elmoreden Cemetery.<br>
My boss is in the Pilgrim's Necropolis. He also helps people visit the cemetery.<br>
Would you like to visit the cemetery of the Elmoreden empire?<br>
