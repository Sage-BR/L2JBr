<html><body>Vice Hierarch Zenya:<br>
In the Imperial Tomb, there are four Sepulchers. I think you need an Entrance Pass to get inside the sepulchers. The monsters collected these Entrance Passes while collecting the relics. If you need a Entrance Pass tothe Sepulchers, get a mission to collect Relics of the Empire. As you kill monsters for their Relics, you will run across Entrance Passes.<br>
If you want to know more about the four Sepulchers in detail, find the Nameless Spirit deep in the tomb.<br>
