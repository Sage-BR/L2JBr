<html><body>Fire Dragon Bride Leona Blackbird:<br>
Everything has its origin. Pa'agrio breathed the soul of fire into Orcs, while Maphr created Dwarves with the spirit of the earth. Humans were made by Gran Kain, and a part of our souls still contains the chaos we were built with. Beleth seeks to extract this chaos from human souls and use it to create Core Naia.<br>
