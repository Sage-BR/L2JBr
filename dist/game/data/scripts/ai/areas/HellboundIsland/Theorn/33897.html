Hey there! I'm researching the power of Heroes, and boy do I need lots of <font color="LEVEL">Skill Points</font> for it! Do you want to <font color="LEVEL">donate yours</font>? If things go well, <font color="LEVEL">you can earn additional SP!</font> Interested? Here's the trick.<br>
This research requires <font color="LEVEL">100,000 Adena</font> and <font color="LEVEL">500,000 SP</font>. <font color="LEVEL">If my experiment is a success, I can pay you in double the SP</font>! But <font color="LEVEL">if it fails, say goodbye to the SP</font>! Oh, and no refunds for your Adena. It's necessary for my research!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">And don't die! Or else you will lose the buff I give you, and lose out on rewards.</font><br>
And I'm kind of a night-owl, so don't expect me to be around to reward you in the daytime.<br>
Well, what do you say? I'm at the end of my experimental stages, so all that's left to do is to inject some SP into either the Flask of Darkness or Flask of Light. Here, I'll let you pick.<br>
