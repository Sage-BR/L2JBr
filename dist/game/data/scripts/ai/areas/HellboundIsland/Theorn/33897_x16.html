Excellent! Emotions overwhelm me! Since our meeting, you have become even stronger. So until the completion is very little do you want to continue? Can stop here<br>
<font color="LEVEL">But if you want to continue, then I'll understand everything without words ...But think well, because if this attempt turns out you are all SP who were before.</font><br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h Quest Theorn stop_4">"I think 16x SP is enough, don't you? I'll stop."</Button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h Quest Theorn darkness_5">"Sure, bring me the Flask of Darkness."</Button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h Quest Theorn light_5">"I think I'm addicted to this. Give me the Flask of Light."</Button>
