It doesn't appear you have an honorary certificate on you.<br>
I am a member of the Kingdom's Royal Guard, and am but an administrative officer who handles administrative affairs relating to Atelia Fortress.<br>
If you do not have the Honorary Member Certificate, there is no way that you can prove the work you have done. Therefore, we cannot offer you any rewards.
