I am now in charge of administrative affairs relating to Atelia Fortress.<br>
While the Aden Vanguard will be involved with special operations within the Atelia Fortress, much as it was before, all other work has been officially handed over to the Kingdom's Royal Guard. This means that any honorary member certificates issued by the Royal Guard of the Kingdom are no longer effective.<br>
In appreciation of your hard work so far, if you <font color="LEVEL">return your Honorary Member Certificate back</font>, we will give you an <font color="LEVEL">appropriate award</font>.<br>
