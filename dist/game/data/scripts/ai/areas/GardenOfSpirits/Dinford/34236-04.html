If you prepare the ingredients and expense necessary for making a Kingdom's Royal Guard Talisman, I will use the methods I have learned from the wizards of the Kingdom's Royal Guard to make the talisman.<br>
The core ingredients are the <font color="LEVEL">Blood Crystal</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Energy</font>, of which the <font color="LEVEL">Blood Crystal</font> can be obtained through the supply boxes you receive after helping with the assignments of the Kingdom's Royal Guard.<br>
Upgrades can be performed in the same manner. Of course, performance enhancements sometimes require additional materials, so be sure to check what materials you need.<br>
