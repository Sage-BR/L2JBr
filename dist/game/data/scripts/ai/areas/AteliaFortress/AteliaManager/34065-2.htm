The Embryo are training their new recruits in the <font color="LEVEL">Command Post</font>. 
The security is so tight, that going inside is hard in itself.<br>The one way to go in is when <font color="LEVEL">Burnstein</font> comes out and <font color="LEVEL">tries to go back inside the Command Post</font>. We have our own method to do that.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Devianne</font> is hiding near the <font color="LEVEL">entrance to the Command Post</font> on the 3rd floor, to hold the gate open whenever Burnstein goes back inside. It should be helpful when you are trying to go inside.<br>
