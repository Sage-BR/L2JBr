The <font color="LEVEL">Command Post</font> is on the <font color="LEVEL">3rd floor of the Atelia Fortress</font>. <font color="LEVEL">Burnstein</font> is the leader, and it is said that he comes out from time to time to train the new recruits.<br>
No one knows what's going on inside, and it's very difficult to go inside because you have to hold the gate when <font color="LEVEL">Commander Burnstein</font> <font color="LEVEL">goes back inside the Command Post from outside</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Devianne</font> has come all the way here, and is hiding near the <font color="LEVEL">entrance to the Command Post</font>, to hold the gate open whenever Burnstein comes and goes back in.<br>
If you are trying to go inside the Command Post, go find Devianne.<br>
