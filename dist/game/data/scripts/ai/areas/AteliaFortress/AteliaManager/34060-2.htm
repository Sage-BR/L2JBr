Although this place is the closest to the entrance, you still have to face many Embryo on the way here.<br>
Elikia heard of the situation and made this Teleport Device for us. If you'll be staying for a while, it will be very useful.<br>
But I heard that it only works for 24 hours, since it's not perfect. Still, you should find it useful.<br>If you come back tomorrow, I'll prepare a new one for you.<br>
