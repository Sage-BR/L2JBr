The <font color="LEVEL">Command Post</font> is known to be the place where new soldiers are trained. We don't know what kind of soldiers they are creating, though.<br>
What we do know is that the gate opens when <font color="LEVEL">Burnstein</font> <font color="LEVEL">comes out and goes back inside the Command Post</font>. Since the gate rarely opens, it's hard for us to go inside the investigate.<br>
That's why we asked Devianne for help to hold the gate open.<br>
The only way we can get inside is by having <font color="LEVEL">Devianne</font>, who is hiding near the <font color="LEVEL">entrance to the Command Post</font>, hold the gate open when Burnstein goes back inside.<br>
