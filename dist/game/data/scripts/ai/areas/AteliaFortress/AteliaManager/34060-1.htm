Who are you! Identify yourself!<br>
Well, you don't look like the enemy. What brings you to this dangerous place? <br>
Have you come after hearing that the Aden Vanguard has secured strongholds in the Atelia Fortress? What? I wasn't captured. It's called infiltration. Hmph.<br>
Anyway thanks to you and your friends we were to secure this stronghold, so I should reward you.<br>
