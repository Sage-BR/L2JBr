Tejakar Ketra! Welcome, comrade! I'm a supplier of specialty items! The elder tells me that you're interested in buying something!<br>
How about this low-level booty pouch? Someday, when you're qualified to open it, you'll have the strongest armor available!<br>
Bring me a <font color="LEVEL">Buffalo Horn</font> and I'll give you whatever you want!<br>
What would you like?<br>
