<html><body>Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:<br>
You must remember that once you have been transformed, you <font color="LEVEL">must not go into deep water</font>. Once you have reverted to your original form, your soul will need time to recover -- you will not be able to transform again for some time. Understand?<br>
Other than that... Each individual soul contains its own <font color="LEVEL">unique character</font>. If you transform into something that matches that character, you may earn some benefits. Think of it as wearing clothes that fit you perfectly. Play around and see what fits you best.<br>
