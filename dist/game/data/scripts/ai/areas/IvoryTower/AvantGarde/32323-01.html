<html><body>Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:<br>
Greetings, I'm Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde. I used to be a vagabond for a long time, and only settled down here recently.<br>
Well, I'm not really a wizard of the Ivory Tower. Let's just say that I got lucky during my travels. My magic requires special materials.<br>
If you have them, and if you also acquired the magic from the den of the Wizard of Darkness, there may be things I could do for you.<br>
