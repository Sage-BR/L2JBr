Here is the Maguen Plasma Collector.<br1>
Remember these rules:<br1>
1. Collect <font color="LEVEL">one of each type</font>, or <font color="LEVEL">several of the same type</font>.<br1>
2. Collecting random Maguen Plasmas can overload the Plasma Collector and will release any plasma you have collected. Yes, this means you'll have to start all over again.
