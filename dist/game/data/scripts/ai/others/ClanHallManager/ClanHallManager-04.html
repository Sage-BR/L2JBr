This function opens and closes the clan hall door.<br>
When the door open, anyone can enter -- even those who are not members of the clan. For security purposes, you should keep the door closed as much as possible.<br>
If you wish to expel non-clan members, use the &nbsp;<a action="bypass -h Quest ClanHallManager expel">Expel Outsider</A>&nbsp; menu.<br>
