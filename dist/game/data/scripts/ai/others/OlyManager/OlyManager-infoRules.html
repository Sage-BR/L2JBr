<html><body>Grand Olympiad Manager:<br>
The Grand Olympiad has the following rules:<br>
The Olympiad is only available from 20:00 to 23:40 every Friday and Saturday.<br>
There are two types of Olympiad matches: class-specific, and free-for-all.<br>
To become a hero of the Grand Olympiad, you must win the highest number of matches. The person or team who inflicts the most damage on their opponent -- not on the opponent's servitor, golem, or pet -- will be declared the winner.<br>
The winner of a match takes Olympiad Points from the loser, amounting to 1/5th of the total points belonging to whoever had less at the beginning.<br1>
For example, if one participant has 60 points and the other has 40, the winner of the match would receive 8 points (1/5th of 40), while the loser would lose 8 points. In a draw, each would lose 1/5 of their own points.<br>
The maximum number of points at stake is capped at 10.<br>
At the beginning of the Olympiad, and at regular intervals throughout the contest, all participants will be awarded a small amount of points. Contestants must have at least 1 point in order to compete in a match.<br>
