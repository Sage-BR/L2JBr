<html><body>Black Marketeer of Mammon:<br>
Do you have a <font color="LEVEL">Guard Agathion Fragment</font>? Then you've come to the right place. I use those fragments to create <font color="LEVEL">Agathion Charms containing the power of Masia's, Paulina's or Tersi's Guard</font>.<br>
Also, I make exchanges with <font color="LEVEL">Book of Growth: Guard Agathion</font> which helps with the growth of the Guard Agathion. You'll need <font color="LEVEL">Angel's Breath</font> to exchange and it's sold a Merchant of Mammon.<br>
