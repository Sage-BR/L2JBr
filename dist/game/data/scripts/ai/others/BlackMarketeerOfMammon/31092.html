<html><body>Black Marketeer of Mammon:<br>
The Lords of Dawn and the Revolutionary Troops of Dusk use <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Adena</font> as their currency, following in the old empire's tradition.<br>
Tradition and customs are important but they are so old... If you were to go to the market with that money in this day and age, you couldn't buy a thing.<br>
Do you have any ancient adena that you don't know what to do with? If you do, I'll exchange them for adena.<br>
Also, if your weapon has a special ability that you do not want, I can remove that, too. I dont't know why you would want to take off a special ability that's been bestowed on your weapon, but we'll do anything for adena.<br>
I have also obtained some rare goods, so stop by some time - these items aren't easy to obtain!<br>
