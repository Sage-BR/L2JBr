<html><body>Ambassador of %castleName%:<br><br>
My master is the great ruler of %castleName% Castle. The message I am commanded to relay to you, the new possessor of this fortress, is: "Protect this territory from our enemies!"<br>
If you do not have the strength to protect this place, my master inquires whether you would care to use our clan's strength to develop your skills.<br>
