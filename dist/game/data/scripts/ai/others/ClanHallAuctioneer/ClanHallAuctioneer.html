<br>Looking into getting a clan hall?<br>
Well thought! A clan needs a clan hall, no?<br>
There are <font color="FFFB99">auctionable clan halls</font> to bid on, and <font color="FFFB99">provisional clan halls</font> can be obtained through a lottery.<br>
Take your time and get a good look!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">(When the amount you bid gets returned to the Clan Warehouse, the total amount that exceeds 100 billion Adena will disappear.)</font><br><br>
