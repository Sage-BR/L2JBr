<html><body>Master Talbot:<br>
Welcome, child of the blade! All those who walk the path of the sword are brethren, members of the same family!<br>Remember that. Others will never understand the ties that bind us together: the long hours of training, the dedication to our craft, the ability to honor a foe even as you strike him down. You must remember your obligations to this fraternity of warriors, even as you advance in rank and prestige...<br>
