<html><body>Recruiter:<br>
If you're on Premium subscription, and reached Lv. 18, you can request to enter the Training Camp through a recruiter in any town.<br1>Don't worry about the severity of the training, though. Our systematic training will guarantee your growth no matter what.<br1>
Remember, time will continue to pass while training, so &nbsp;<font color="LEVEL">the clock is ticking on your buffs and enchants</font>. Also, items that affect XP such as &nbsp;<font color="LEVEL">Runes and Agathions </font> have no effect there.<br>
The training is limited to 5 hours a day, so no need to push yourself beyond that. Also, feel free to leave and come back to fill up the rest of the 5 hours!<br>
