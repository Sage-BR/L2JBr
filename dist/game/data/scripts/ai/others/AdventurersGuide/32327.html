<html><body>Adventurers' Guide:<br>
Greetings, traveler! How may I be of assistance?<br>
My job is to offer what little assistance I can as you charge into all this endless evil and intense fighting!<br>
Even now, the monster attacks on this village grow stronger each day; it is only due to your tireless efforts that we have remained safe this long.<br>
