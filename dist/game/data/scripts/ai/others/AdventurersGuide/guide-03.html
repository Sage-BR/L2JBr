You can use Steel Door Guild Coins to purchase <font color="LEVEL">weapons, armor, and accessories of each grade</font>. These items may be restricted in terms of augmentations or attribute options, but they will be more than enough to help you on your journey.<br>
Once you outgrow the equipment, <font color="LEVEL">you can trade them back for Steel Door Guild Coins again</font>! You can also invest in the Aden Reconstruction project if it suits your fancy, or even gamble. Don't forget that Steel Weapon Packs and Steel Armor Packs have a chance of yielding Requiem, Apocalypse, or Specter equipment!<br>
