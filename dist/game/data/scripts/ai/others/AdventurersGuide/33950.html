<html><body>Apprentice Adventurers' Guide:<br>
You're about to start a long journey.<br>
My job is to offer what little assistance I can as you charge into all this endless evil and intense fighting!<br>
Of course, I'm just an apprentice, so I can't help you as much as the full-fledged Adventurers' Guides.<br>
