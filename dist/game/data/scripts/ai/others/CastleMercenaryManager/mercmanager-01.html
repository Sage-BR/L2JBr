Sign a contract with me, and I'll give you a certificate stating that my mercenaries are in your employ. Place it wherever you wish to assign them.<br>
Place the certificate on the ground at the beginning of the battle and they will be summoned. They will position themselves wherever you are and in the direction you look. Most importantly, they'll defend you, my lord, to the death!<br>
If you wish to re-position them, simply pick up the certificate and place it where you wish them to be.<br>
You can buy as many certificates as you want, but there is a limit to the number of mercenaries that can be hired.<br>

You cannot position the mercenaries too closely together, and they must be assigned inside the castle. Of course, if you place the certificate in other castles, the mercenaries will not be able to come to your aid.<br>
The contract between us will be terminated at the end of the siege. You may use any unused certificates in another battle.<br>
