Do you carry any Life Crystals with you?<br>
Due to some strange new influence, it has become impossible to gain any Life Crystals from the monsters on the Aden Continent.<br>
Whatever life crystals you have will be exchanged at the same value as before. We are working to identify the cause... please rest assured nothing will go wrong, and exchange your crystals with the supplies we have prepared.<br>
