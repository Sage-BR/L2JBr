<html><body>Merchant of Mammon:<br>
May Mammon's blessings be upon you! Mammon's Guild is here to showcase our rare item collection.<br>
Before you start shopping, there are a few things you should know. While we dealt only in Ancient Adena in the past, now we take Adena like any other merchant. Also, you must bring a <font color="LEVEL">Blank Scroll</font> if you plan to purchase an Enchant Scroll. If you bring us Soul Crystal Fragments, we can make them into whole Soul Crystals. We also have <font color="LEVEL">Elcyum</font> to upgrade items.<br>
Remember, local tax rates apply!<br>
