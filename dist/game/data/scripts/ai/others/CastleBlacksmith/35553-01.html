What brings you to this shabby place?<br>
By the way, I've learned a new skill from our Blacksmith Guild! Now I use a wider variety of crops to make the items you need, my Lord.<br>
Our Dwarves are truly gifted with their hands.. Ha! Oops! Pardon me, my Lord.<br>
If you want me to make something for you, just ask.<br><br>
