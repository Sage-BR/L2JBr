If you conquer all of the barracks, weakening your opponents' defensive system, the command gate will open. Entering the command post, you will find a Combat Flag on the first floor that symbolizes the authority of the fort. You can end the battle by hanging it from the flag pole on the very highest floor.<br><br>
Be warned, though, that you must conquer the fortress within 10 minutes or all of the barracks' functions will return to normal.<br>
