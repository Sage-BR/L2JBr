There are so many strange things about the Material Realm. Apparently we need Adena just to get some clothes!<br>
So I've asked Zephyra to help me create items of value so that the Ertheia can make some Adena. The research was very hard, but it was worth it!<br>
How about it? Shall we embark on researching the mysterious together? Just remember, only Ertheia Lv. 40 or above who have completed 1st Liberation can learn this skill.<br>
