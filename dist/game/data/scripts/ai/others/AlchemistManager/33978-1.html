Only the Ertheia from the Spirit Realm may learn alchemy.<br>
Because Alchemy creates rare materials, it requires rigorous training. You must complete your 1st Liberation at least to learn the basics of alchemy. Remember that!<br>
Alchemy consists of <font color="LEVEL">Combination</font>, using an Alchemy Cube, and <font color="LEVEL">Transmutation</font> for all kinds of rare items. There is one more thing you will require, but you will find out when you are ready.<br>
