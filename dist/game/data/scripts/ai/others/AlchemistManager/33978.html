There's so much we don't know about in the Material Realm. They require us to pay with Adena for everything.<br>
So I started my research with Veruti. I also got help from the spirits. Research was hard, but then we discovered a new skill that can save Adena by creating valuable goods.<br>
So, do you want to join my research? By the way, only Lv. 40 or above Ertheia who have completed their 1st Liberation may learn Alchemy.<br>
