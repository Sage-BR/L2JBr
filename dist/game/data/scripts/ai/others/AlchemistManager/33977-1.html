Alchemy can only be learned by Ertheia from the Spirit Realm.<br>
It requires arduous training if one is to produce rare items, so you need to have at least undergone 1st Liberation in order to understand the basics of it!<br>
Alchemy is divided into <font color="LEVEL">Combination</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Transmutation</font>. The Alchemy Cube is used in Combination while Transmutation allows you to transmute a variety of rare items. There's one more category, but I'll tell you about it later when the time is right. Hehe!<br>
