<font color="LEVEL">Assassins</font> kill silently and swiftly, then vanish into the forest. Darkness is their friend and companion, aiding their skill in concealment and spying. They target an enemy's weak points with small but deadly weapons like daggers, or fire arrows from a long distance away. If the Palus Knights fight against their enemies in open war, Assassins secure victory silently on dark, moonless nights.<br>
The best Assassins are selected as <font color="LEVEL">Abyss Workers</font>, allowing them to refine their skills of death-dealing and perception. Assassins particularly skilled in archery may become <font color="LEVEL">Phantom Rangers</font>.<br>
