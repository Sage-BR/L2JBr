The <font color="LEVEL">Palus Knights</font> are the best knights of our clan: fast and deadly accurate in attack and stolidly effective in defense. They are well-rounded warriors, unlike many in this age.<br>
The most exceptional among the Palus Knights may go on to be selected as a <font color="LEVEL">Shillien Knight</font>, renowned as the personal guard of Shilen, or a <font color="LEVEL">Blade Dancer</font>, whose twin swords weave a whirlwind dance of destruction<br>
