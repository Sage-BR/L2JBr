A <font color="LEVEL">Cleric</font> is a Mystic connected to the divine power that surrounds the world. They practice mostly white magic and support magic, helping others with god-powered miracles. With their superior healing powers, Clerics are generally welcome wherever they go. Clerics who develop their spiritual abilities sufficiently may rise to the level of <font color="LEVEL">Bishop</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Prophet</font>.<br>
