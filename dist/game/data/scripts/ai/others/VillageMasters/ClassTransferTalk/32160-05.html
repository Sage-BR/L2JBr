<font color="LEVEL">Shillien Oracles</font> are priests of darkness who fulfill the prophecies of Shilen through their study of darkness and death, as well as the spirits of destruction and chaos spawned from Gran Kain. Unlike Human and Elven Priests, who look to the gods of light, Shillien Oracles understand the truth of both light and darkness. As a result, they can not only can heal and protect their comrades through white magic, but also can curse opponents or steal their energy by means of black magic.<br>
The most spiritually advanced Shillien Oracles are chosen as <font color="LEVEL">Shillien Elders</font>. The Shillien Elders are our spiritual leaders -- they understand the divine natures of Shilen and Gran Kain better than anyone else.<br>
