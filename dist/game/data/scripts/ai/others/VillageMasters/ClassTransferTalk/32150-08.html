<html><body>High Prefect Took:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Orc Shamans</font> have the blessing of Pa'agrio, the Lord of Flame, and are Priests that perform miracles with fire. They bless warriors going into battle to strengthen their attack skills, while placing curses on their enemies to cripple and hinder them. They are the pride of the Orcs, whose abilities become far stronger when they act in unison with other Shamans.<br>
Many of the most highly qualified Shamans become <font color="LEVEL">Chief Candidates</font> and are called <font color="LEVEL">Overlords</font>. Others are selected as <font color="LEVEL">Warcryers</font> and are taught even stronger spells.<br>
