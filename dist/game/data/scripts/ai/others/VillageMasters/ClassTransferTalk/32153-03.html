A <font color="LEVEL">Wizard</font> is an advanced Mystic who can practice elemental magic, black magic and summoning magic. Those who practice their art and develop their skill may aspire to be <font color="LEVEL">Sorcerers, Warlocks or Necromancers</font>. A Wizard can strike down enemies directly using powerful magic, but to concentrate on attack magic, he must turn his back on both white magic and summoning magic. Even with those limitations, it is a fascinating profession -- particularly the ability to summon servitors.<br>
