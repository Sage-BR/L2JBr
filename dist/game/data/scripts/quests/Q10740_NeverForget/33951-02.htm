Did you see the tower on the way here? It's for those who were lost while we were settling in. On the day we were attacked by the monsters, I was in the Whispering Woods and calming the spirits...and Lorne was dying at that very moment. My love...he was a great man. A Surr, but without an ounce of prejudice or disdain for the Nann.<br>
