You're smart. That's good. Go to Dragon Valley, defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Hatchlings</font>, and bring back <font color="LEVEL">50 Hatchling Flesh.</font><br>
These hatchlings are very weary. When they are attacked, they will flee nearly Dragon Vortex, and transform into Leopard Dragons. You can also obtain Hatchling Flesh by slaying these <font color="LEVEL">Leopard Dragons.</font><br>
Bring back what's been asked of you, and you will receive your reward. No questions necessary.<br>
