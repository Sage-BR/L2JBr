You are nice! You even cheer for my love. Sniff.<br>
The first key will be found from killing <font color="LEVEL">Marionette Spirits</font>.<br>
Someone cruel had locked the key inside the Marionette Spirit and turned it into a puppet under a powerful spell.<br>
What's even more scary is that he made it impossible to get the key without killing the Marionette Spirit.<br>
But it's the only choice we have to save the spirits. Go kill <font color="LEVEL">Marionette Spirits</font> and get me <font color="LEVEL">Magic Chain Key 1.</font>
