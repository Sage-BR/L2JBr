Now Crystal Caverns is in the hands caused by demons and Belefom Baylor, who directs. I think they're trying to get by with Fafuriona Fanariona Gems, located in the depths of the Crystal Caverns. And demons and minions Shilen represent a huge threat to us, but if they can awaken Fanarion ... Oh, with this disaster, I think we will not cope. We must stop as soon as Baylor and his demons. Please help me.<br>
