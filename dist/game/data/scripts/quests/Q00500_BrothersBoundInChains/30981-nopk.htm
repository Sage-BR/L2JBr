<html><body>Black Judge:<br>
Everyone commits sin, whether great or small. And when the sin becomes great, you move away from the light until you become darkness. Sin is close to your nature, and can only be eliminated when your soul is string. Come again sometime, and I will help you step closer to the light.<br>
