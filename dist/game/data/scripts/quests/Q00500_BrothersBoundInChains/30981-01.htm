<html><body>Dark Judge:<br>
I may look like this now, but I was once an angel of light. But the light was put to sleep, and darkness filled the lands... we fought, all of us angels, but it was a losing battle. Then, when I was growing weary, the god of chaos beckoned. "Chaos is the ultimate peace and silence," he whispered, and I did not have the strength to resist him.<br>
But I ended up regretting my decision in the end. So I made another deal with the god of chaos; I would bring him enough "sins" to cancel out my own. So here's my offer to you: I will buy your sin. After all, penitence is the only path to light. Will you accept?<br>
