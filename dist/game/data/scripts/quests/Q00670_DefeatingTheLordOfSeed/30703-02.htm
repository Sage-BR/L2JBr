You know that there are areas called Seeds in Gracia, don't you?<br>
There are four Seeds, Destruction, Infinity, Annihilation, and Hellfire. Each Seed is guarded by a Seed Lord.<br>
The Seed Lords are not ordinary people... Shilen herself appointed them. In fact, their roles are similar to those of Anakim and Lilith. All of them work to strengthen Shilen's power.<br>
