<html><body>Fishing Guild Member:<br>
With more explorers fishing, more people aware of the benefits of the sport, and less reason for the royal servants to oppose it, Santiago will make himself known to the public, stressing how awesome a hobby fishing is. The plan is that when this happens, his majesty the King will take the opportunity to acknowledge our guild and allow us to engage in our activities openly on the Aden continent.<br>
To this end, we have agreed that whenever a fisher comes to us with proof that they have made 100 successful catches, we will acknowledge that they have helped us out, and will give them gifts.
