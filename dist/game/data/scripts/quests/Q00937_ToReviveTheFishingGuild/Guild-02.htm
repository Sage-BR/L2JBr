Actually, the king himself loves fishing. Did you know that the Fishing Guild was hung out to dry because the royal servants are against us?<br>
Of course, all of this information is supposed to be confidential. I was only able to come across it because I'm stationed in Aden Castle.<br>
Anyways, the King is also working hard to return the Fishing Guild to good standing, but it's not easy, given how vehemently opposed the royal servants are.<br>
