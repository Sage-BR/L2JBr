We're sorry, but in order to show the world that you adventurers can't get enough of fishing, and that fishing is a truly beneficial sport, we need data as well.<br>
The minimum effort required for data collection is 100 catches, so I hope you aren't too offended. Please fish a bit more, and come back later.
