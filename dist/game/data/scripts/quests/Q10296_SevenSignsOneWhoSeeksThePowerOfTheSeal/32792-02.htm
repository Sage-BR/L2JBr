I don't know if your questions about Embryo have been answered. I wonder if it has something to do with Jude van Etina disappearing after stealing Solina's power...<br>
Clearly Embryo's activities have not been stopped, even now. 3 seals have already risen above ground.<br>
You must investigate the real identity of Embryo, the world needs to know. Alas, I have a favor to ask you.<br>
