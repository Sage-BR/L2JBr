I believe we have enough information now. No matter what Hardin or the other Dusks say... Don't ever falter. Hardin is not someone you can trust. Now, seems like we are one step ahead toward the truth. I believe I will need your help again later on. I will ask you a favor again when that time comes. Good work!
