You fought well, perhaps you were confidant having fought him before. He had only absorbed the power of 2 seals, and by using a virtual image he found us in this dimension. The scary part is that even with his limited power, I couldn't defeat him.<br>
We cannot allow any remaining seals to fall Into Embyo's possession! If he absorbs more power... We may never be able to stop him...<br>
