<font color="LEVEL">Teredor</font> keeps being sighted around the Dwarven town... They say he's some kind of Earth Wyrm, probably even related to that <font color="LEVEL">Trasken</font> monster who ruined the Dwarven tower. At least he isn't as strong as Trasken.<br>
Still, his poison's potent enough that we had to close all mines, which is threatening a lot of people's livelihood.<br>
That's not even our biggest problem.<br>
