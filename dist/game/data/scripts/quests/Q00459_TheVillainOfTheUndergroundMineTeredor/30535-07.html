Did you defeat it? You look a bit battered, but not too bad, considering the task. Thankfully the evil energy seems to be calming down. Maybe that will weaken the Earth Wyrm.<br>
You've done well. Please, take this as a reward, you earned it.<br>
But, Shilen is still strong. So stick around, will you? Come back when you've rested. We can use all the help we can get.
