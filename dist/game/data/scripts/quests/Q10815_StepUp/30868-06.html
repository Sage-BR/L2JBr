You haven't done enough yet. You need to learn how to communicate with others.<br>
I'm giving a certificate to those who have used the <font color="LEVEL">World Chat</font> at least <font color="LEVEL">30 times</font>.<br>
You can use the World Chat by putting your message after <font color="LEVEL">&</font>.
