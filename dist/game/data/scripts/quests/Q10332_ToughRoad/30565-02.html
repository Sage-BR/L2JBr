<html><body>Pa'agrio Lord Kakai:<br>
Lord Lewin Waldner of Gludio Castle is an old friend of mine, but I can't abandon my duties here to go help him. Since I can't go, I'd like to send someone I trust. You.<br>
You can head right over there. Just go to the <font color="LEVEL">Center of the Town of Gludio</font>, through <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Melia</font> (who's by the left museum path). Once you arrive, go see <font color="LEVEL">Captain Bathis</font> and give him this letter of introduction. He'll be able to fill you in on the latest Sakum sightings.<br>
May the Flame of Pa'agrio follow you, always!
