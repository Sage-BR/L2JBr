<html><body>Pa'agrio Lord Kakai:<br>
You've hear that <font color="LEVEL">Sakum</font> disappeared into the labyrinth, right? We'll, it looks like he's come back out. I've been getting reports of Sakum sightings all around Aden. Some of them are probably just cases of nervous people and moving shadows, but they can't all be incorrect. In fact, Lord Lewin Waldner of Gludio has requested that we send troops.<br>
I'd like to assign you to this task. Are you willing to go?<br>
