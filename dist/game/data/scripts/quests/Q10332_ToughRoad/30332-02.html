Nemertess? Yeees, I've heard of him. He was interrupted while trying to hatch Sakum. I sent him to the continent!<br>
We've been seeing Sakum around, sporadically. It doesn't appear to be under anyone's control, but it's so fast... we haven't managed to get close enough to tell what condition it's in. And now, we can't even find it! We need to track it down, it's just not safe having it running about.<br>
