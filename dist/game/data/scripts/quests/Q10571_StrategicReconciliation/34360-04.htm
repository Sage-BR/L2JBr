It's not much, it should be easy.<br>
See Ruine next to you? Ask Ruine to teleport you to a Dimensional Rift or Dimensional Crack. I've already told her to send you to wherever you want.<br>

While sealing with monsters in the Dimensional Rift or Dimensional Crack, you can find Dimensional Traces. Gather them for me. Not so difficult for you, right?
