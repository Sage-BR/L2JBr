Good idea. I did not confirm that device myself. Rather, someone else had reported.<br>
I'm not sure what it is, but it's definitely not ours. It looks similar to the one the delegation had, which is why I was sure that it was that.<br>
First go find <font color="LEVEL">Shuvann</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Fields of Massacre</font>. It was him who found the device first.
