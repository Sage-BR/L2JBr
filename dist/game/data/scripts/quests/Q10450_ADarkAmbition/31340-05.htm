When you get to <font color="LEVEL">Gainak</font>, you'll see the Flame Patrol, who are watching for any incidents outside Gainak. Look for <font color="LEVEL">Flame Patrol Vice Captain Tuska</font>, who's patrolling in the area. Tell him that he'll have to keep watch in nearby areas as well because things are getting more dangerous near Gainak. Also, tell him to maintain a high level of readiness until we recruit more reinforcements.
