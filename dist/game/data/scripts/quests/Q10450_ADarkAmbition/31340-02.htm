You know Noble Orcs, the orcs in the Town of Rune? Your friends. Well, the <font color="LEVEL">Orc Supervia</font> are a group that stood against these <font color="LEVEL">Noble Orcs</font>.<br>
They're the strongest of all Orcs, and founded <font color="LEVEL">Gainak</font> to build an Orc kingdom. Even an alliance of our Elmore Kingdom and the Noble Orcs barely held them in check, and it was with the help of Pa'agrio Lord Kakai that we were recently able to declare a ceasefire.<br>
The thing is...this ceasefire. I don't trust it.<br>
