<html><body>Captain Mathias:<br>
Traveler, be careful in these lands. I am working on a secret mission for King Astair of Elmore. While we are desperately in need of assistance, I will not send the unready to their deaths. Should you hone your skills, you know where to find me.<br>
(Only characters level 99 or above may undertake this quest.)
