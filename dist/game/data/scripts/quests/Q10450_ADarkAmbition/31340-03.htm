<html><body>Captain Mathias:<br>
The combat skill of the Orc Supervia is legendary. When they were fighting against the Noble Orcs, we saw how powerful they were firsthand... It was like the day when the Blackish Red Fog appeared.<br>
Even though a ceasefire has been declared, I think they're plotting something behind the scenes. Kakai the Lord of Flame agrees with me, and that's why the Flame Patrol is staying near Gainak permanently.<br>
According to their report, some strange energy has been felt near Gainak. So Kakai and the whole Town of Rune are watching for any movement there.<br>
