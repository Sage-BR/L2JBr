You are so impatient! I was going to give you all the details.<br>
There are 4 <font color="LEVEL">checkpoints</font> at <font color="LEVEL">Raider's Crossroads</font>. When you are up on a checkpoint, you can see the surrounding area very well. That's why the <font color="LEVEL">Nerva Orc Prefect</font> gives instructions to nearby Nerva Orcs from there.<br>
The Nerva Orc Prefect is pretty good at his job, making the lives of us Flame Patrol pretty hard.<br>
My friend, do you understand what I am trying to say?<br>
