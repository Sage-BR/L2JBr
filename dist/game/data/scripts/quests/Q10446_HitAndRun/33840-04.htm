Good, you don't talk too much either. I like you even more! You and I will make good partners.<br>
Now, go to the <font color="LEVEL">checkpoints</font> at <font color="LEVEL">Raider's Crossroads</font> and beat up <font color="LEVEL">Nerva Orc Prefects</font>. Maybe... like <font color="LEVEL">10</font> of them?<br>
When they die, smoke will come out of the checkpoints as a sign of danger.<br>
Be careful. Nerva Orcs might suddenly attack you. If you think it's getting too dangerous, just get rid of the Nerva Orc Prefect and run away!<br>
Why that look on your face? Hit and run is a highly-advanced strategy, it's not cowardly at all! You didn't know that?
