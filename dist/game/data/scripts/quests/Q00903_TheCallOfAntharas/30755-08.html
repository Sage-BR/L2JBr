<html><body>Watcher of Antharas Theodric:<br>
Hmmm... leather from the Tarask and Behemoth dragons? Let's see... yes these do appear to contain the power Antharas in these hides. I appreciate your time in gathering these for me. Now give me a moment...<br>
Here, this scroll is made from the same leather you have collected from me. It allows you to teleport instantly to the Heart of Warding.<br>
While you should have no need for it now, when the time comes for you to face Antharas again this should save you some leg work.
