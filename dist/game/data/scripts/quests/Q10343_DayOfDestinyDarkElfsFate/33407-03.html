Many Aden Vanguard Members have died at the Cemetary. Please bring back 4 keepsakes from their bodies.<br1>
It's horrible, but we haven't been able to retrieve the bodies. They're scattered all over the Cemetary, but your best bet would be to check the corners of the square guarded by the Grave Guards. It's between the Seal of Shilen and the Cemetary.
