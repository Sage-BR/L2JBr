Good. Seeing you grow like this is why I love what I do. Hmm... Something to help you? Right, I have some items ready for you this time as I well.<br>
I need to tell you about <font color="LEVEL">La Vie En Rose's Noble Brooch</font>. Like the Talisman I gave you last time, a brooch is an item that equips jewels for unique effects. Your Jewel Slot will be activated once you equip a brooch.<br>
Try equipping the <font color="LEVEL">Emerald Lv. 1 jewel</font> I gave you. Each jewel has a different effect so equipping jewels that suit you best will help you grow stronger.<br>
If you're ready for the next step, speak to me again.<br>
