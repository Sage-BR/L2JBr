We were careless. The <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious Vagabond</font> was outnumbered, so we thought we'd get him without a problem. But...he wasn't alone. He led us to the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of the Dead</font>, where we were ambushed by his comrades. Only I survived, thanks to the <font color="LEVEL">Mysterious Wizard</font> who healed me, but I am not completely healed. Will you track the Suspicious Vagabond for me?<br>
