<html><body>Grand Master Brome:<br>
You have heard of Shilen's Seal, near Aden Castle, yes? The Goddess of Destruction has opened her evil eyes, and is strengthening her dark powers. The seal is oozing evil energy, and many new monsters have swarmed out, looking for an opportunity to take over Aden Castle.<br>
The Aden Vanguard has gone to the underground lair near the seal to take up the fight, but we haven't heard from them in far too long. We would like you to undertake a search, and, if necessary, a rescue.<br>
