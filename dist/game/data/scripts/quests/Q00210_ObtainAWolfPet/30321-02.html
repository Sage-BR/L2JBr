Raising a wolf, are you? Well, there are many things you must know.<br>
I must first explain their reproductive cycle. A wolf is fertile for <font color="LEVEL">1-2 months</font>, and the pregnancy lasts for approximately <font color="LEVEL>60-62 days</font>. Their litters can be large as 10 cubs, but 3-6 is more normal. They are very protective of their young ones, making homes in little nooks between rocks, under cliffs, and caves. A full grown wolf can easily devour a calf or goat whole, and that's their preferred type of food, but they can also eat the flesh of dead animals, wild pheasants, and even berries. They can go without food for 5-6 days, but cannot live long without water.<br>
Well, I think that about covers it. Go back to <font color="LEVEL">Pet Manager Lundy</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font> and show off your new knowledge.<br>
