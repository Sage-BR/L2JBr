How about a wolf for you first pet?<br>
Wolves are biologically classified as <font color="LEVEL">canines</font>. Canines are extremely varied and include dogs, raccoons, foxes, jakals, and even timberwolves. The lifespan of wolves in the wild is unknown, but wolves in captivity can live from 12 to 15 years.<br>
This is all I can tell you. For more information, go talk to <font color="LEVEL">Guard Brynn</font> in the <font color="LEVEL"> Town of Gludio</font>.<br>
