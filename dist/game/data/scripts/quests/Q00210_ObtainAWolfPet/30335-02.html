Since you are going to have a wolf as a pet, let me tell you about wolves.<br>
They have a great sense of smell. They can even smell their prey up to <font color="LEVEL">2.4 km</font> away. When hunting, a pack of 7 to 13 wolves go around together. Every pack is led by a <font color="LEVEL">male</font>. Regarding their appearance, fully grown ones weigh less than the average adult human. Some people say that dogs are domesticated wolves. But unlike dogs, wolves drop their tail down at times.<br>
This is all I can tell you! For more information, go ask <font color="LEVEL">Trader Sydnia</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font>.<br>
