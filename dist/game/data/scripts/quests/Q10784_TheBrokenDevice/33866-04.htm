The messages don't connect. But guessing from the context, there's something about the device later.<br>
It says they tried to operate the device on the giants, the device stopped working, and then it made a strange sound and started breaking. Then it says that they hurried out with it.<br>
It seems that they broke the device because no one knew how to work with it. Do you want to find a part of the device at least?<br>
