Hmm.. You have taken out <font color="LEVEL">Varka's Silenos Commander Mos</font>, but <font color="LEVEL">Kampf</font> did not show himself. Anyways, it's a good thing that you have taken out <font color="LEVEL">Varka's Silenos Commander Mos</font>.<br>
With in now being out in the open that the <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Varka Silenos</font> has conspired together, leaving one such as him alive cannot be good for us.<br>
