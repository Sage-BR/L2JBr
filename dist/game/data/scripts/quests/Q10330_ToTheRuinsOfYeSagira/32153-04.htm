Thank you for being so eager to accept.<br>
Please head immediately to the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Ye Sagira</font>, and help the seekers with their operation. At the entrance to the Ruins of Ye Sagira should be the former scholar and current Seeker <font color="LEVEL">Lakcis</font>. I believe your help will be required: I ask you to please go and provide your help.<br>
There is no time to lose. So please teleport through <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Milia</font>.
