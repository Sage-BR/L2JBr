Until now, you've said wanted to be a seeker. Then it would be good if you could find something to do along that path.<br>
The seekers are engaged in a search mission in the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Ye Sagira</font>, and they need your help there. I expect your many abilities to be of help in resolving the many problems going on there.<br>
