<html><body>High Priest Franco:<br>
Many Seekers are engaged in searching the Ruins of Ye Sagira. Many are hard at work there, but for many reasons, they're still very short on manpower.<br>
It has been reported that one thought to be connected with the one who intruded into the museum in search of the book appeared there. That's why I'm even more worried.<br>
We would like skilled persons like you to go to the Ruins of Ye Sagira and help out with the search there.<br>
