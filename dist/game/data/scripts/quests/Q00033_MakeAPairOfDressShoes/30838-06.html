Gathering is not for everyone. That's why I'm trying to get someone else do it, haha! Seriously though, I need <font color="LEVEL">360 pieces of Worn Leather and 90 Low-grade Accessory Gems.</font> Oh, and don't forget to bring tailoring fees! It's not just for me - I have to pay other suppliers too, so the whole thing would cost you about <font color="LEVEL">500,000 Adena.</font>
