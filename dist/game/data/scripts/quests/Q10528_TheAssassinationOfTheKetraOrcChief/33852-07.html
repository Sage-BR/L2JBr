So you got rid of <font color="LEVEL">Belos</font>, and killed the chief of <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orcs</font>. working with <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>, huh? what progress!<br>
Of course, that doesn't mean we can let our guard down against <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>. They'll be up to on good somewhere else before long!<br>
We will not forget the help the Ertheia have given us. Anyway, I'll let <font color="LEVEL">Kekropus</font> know of your valor. He will be grateful as well. We the Giant's Minions will always remember you.
