Are you worried? Relax. With the help of an ally, you can resurrect immediately where you died, without paying the <font color="LEVEL">Death Penalty</font>.<br>
A healer with the resurrection skill or someone with a resurrection item such as the Blessed Scroll of Resurrection can revive you.<br>
Others can help you, but that means you can help others too. Keep that in mind.<br>
