It gives my heart true joy to see you grow step by step. I've prepared some items to help you again.<br>
Do you see this <font color="LEVEL">Talisman - Destruction</font>? First, you must learn about <font color="LEVEL">Talismans</font>. A talisman is an item equipped in the right bracelet and has various effects like battle abillities and unique skills.<br>
unfortunately, you can't equip them on left bracelets like the Elementary Seed Bracelet i gave you last time. The left bracelet is usually used to summon Agathion, so remember that you need a right bracelet to equip a Talisman.<br>
If you keep getting stronget like this, I'm sure my days as your teacher are numbered. Come talk to me if you're ready to begin the next step.<br>
