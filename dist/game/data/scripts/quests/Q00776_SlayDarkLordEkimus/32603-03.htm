All right, so this is the rundown. To defeat <font color="LEVEL">Ekimus</font>, you must infiltrate the <font color="LEVEL">Hall of Suffering</font> first, and then reach the <font color="LEVEL">Heart of Infinity</font>.<br>
That's where you will face Ekimus, the Lord of the Undead.<br>
To go to the Hall of Erosion, talk to <font color="LEVEL">Guide of Infinity Jaedin</font> over there.
