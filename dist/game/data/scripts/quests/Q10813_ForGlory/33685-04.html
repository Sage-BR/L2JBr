After a long discussion with Lionel, I've decided that I'll find someone who can prove their strength by constantly participating in the <font color="LEVEL">Ceremony of Chaos</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Olympiad</font>.<br>
In order to keep track of your performance, you'll be getting a <font color="LEVEL">Proof of Battle</font> whenever you participate in the <font color="LEVEL">Ceremony of Chaos</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">Olympiad</font>.<br>
If you can get <font color="LEVEL">80 Proof of Battle</font>, you'll prove that you are worthy. Not too hard, right?</body></html>
