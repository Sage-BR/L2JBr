Giant's Minions have been chasing after <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> for a long time. They recently found out that the organization created clones of <font color="LEVEL">Sakum</font> and one of the clones went to the <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orc Outpost</font>. That's all I know. For more information, you should talk to <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Minion Lugonnes</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orc Outpost</font>. <br>
To get there quickly, use the <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape: Ketra Orc Outpost</font> I gave you. You could also ask a Gatekeeper for help.
