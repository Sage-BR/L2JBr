<html><body>Giant's Minion Lugonnes:<br>
After you destroyed <font color="LEVEL">Sakum</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> created 2 clones of the monster named <font color="LEVEL">Belos</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Kampf</font>.<br>
When I last saw <font color="LEVEL">Belos</font>, he was heading to the <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orc Outpost</font>. It seems like the <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orcs</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> are working together, with Belos as their link. You and I must end this alliance.<br>
There is much to be done. Prepare yourself and speak to me when you are ready.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">- Note: You can develop yourself through quests and hunting at the hunting ground of Ketra Orc Outpost. You can get the next item, Kekropus' Letter, at Lv. 81.</font>
