Thank you. I need to stop receiving help and start giving it, but... it's not easy. The Husk Distribution Report is a report that I've recorded thoroughly even while being haunted by the auditory hallucinations. They caused me to lose it, but I fear the <font color="LEVEL">Husk Crawlers and Husk Kraphers</font> have taken it. They're the most common monsters in Exploration Area 2, you see.<br>
Please slay the Husk Crawler and Husk Krapher, and collect <font color="LEVEL">15 Husk Distribution Reports</font>.<br>
When you're done collecting, please hand the pages to Celin, who stays between Exploration Area 2 and 3, instead of me.
