You've brought all I asked for. Hand them over to me, and I'll give you the reward.<br>
Wait.. You didn't undertake the <font color="LEVEL">Adventure Guild's mission</font>? It's none of my business, but id you don't do it, you will lose a chance to gain an additional reward. <br>
Why don't you reconsider? I hope you make a wise choice.<br>
((If you do <font color="LEVEL">Basic Mission: Altar of Evil</font> and then complete this quest, you can eam additional rewards and Amity Points.)<br>
