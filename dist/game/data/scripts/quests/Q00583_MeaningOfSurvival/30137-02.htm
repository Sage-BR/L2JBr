I am actually working on an antidote for the epidemic along with several Dark Elves who have survived. But I'm not a scholar or a magician, so there aren't that many things I can do. All I can do is collect research materials from nearby monsters to help with the research.<br>
But I'm not a warrior, so that's why I must ask adventurers like you for help.<br>
Please gather research ingredients from the monsters in the Bloody Swampland. If you do so, you'll have my etemal gratitude!<br>
