The problem is that not everyone has found a safe haven. Those who have not found a place to retreat to, or have their reasons for not being able to relocate to some place safe, are bound to die of the epidemic. Many around me have met their demise that way.<br> 
At this rate, the casualties will continue to mount. Could you possibly help me?<br>
