For now, we're not going to remove the fragments from the body of a magic creature.<br>
But, one's already been removed, and we don't know how to put it back in, so destroying it would be our safest option.<br>
We don't know why these fragments were placed inside, so we have to do what we have to do.<br>
We have the perfect device to help destroy this fragment. But I can't leave this place, so it'd be nice if someone else could go and find it.<br>
