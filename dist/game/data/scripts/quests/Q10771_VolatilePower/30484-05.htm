Figured you'd help, so I'll tell you what to do.<br>
You'll find a <font color="LEVEL">Hidden Crusher</font> made by the wizards of Ivory Tower on <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Tower: Underground Lv. 1</font>.<br>
This powerful magical device can destroy any magical object. But, it was hidden to prevent anyone from misusing it, and since it requires magic to destroy something, it could self-destruct by consuming any residual magic left on it.<br>
If the crusher is destroyed before all the fragments are, you'll need to find another one.<br>
After the fragments have been destroyed, bring back <font color="LEVEL">20 Normal Fragment Dust</font>.
