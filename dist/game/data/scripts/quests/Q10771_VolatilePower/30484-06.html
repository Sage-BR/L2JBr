<html><body>Ivory Tower Wizard Janssen:<br>
You haven't left yet? There isn't any time! Hurry. You need to destroy the fragments before the crusher explodes. Do you want to die clutching these fragments?<br>
There's a <font color="LEVEL">Hidden Crusher</font> made by the wizards of Ivory Tower on Cruma Tower: <font color="LEVEL">Underground Lv. 3</font>. Find the crusher and destroy the Shining Mysterious Fragments. And as proof, collect <font color="LEVEL">20 Normal Fragment Dust</font>.<br>
But it requires magic to destroy something, so it could self-destruct by consuming any residual magic left on it.<br>
If the crusher is destroyed before all the fragments are, you'll need to find another one.
