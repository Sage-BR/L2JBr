Alright. The Seed of Annihilation is comprised of three regions, each region with its own environment and set of properties. The monsters in each of these regions have evolved to fit those surroundings, so we've given each clan a name to distinguish them - the <font color="LEVEL">Bistakon, Reptilikon, and Kokracon</font>.<br>
The mission is to wipe them out one region at a time.<br>
So, you scared, or you ready to make terrifying beasts bleed?<br>
