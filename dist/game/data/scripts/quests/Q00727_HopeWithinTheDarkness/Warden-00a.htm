<html><body>Prison Warden:<br>
Strange omens. There have been lots of strange omens of late. The only thing we can rely on in this unstable world is power. As a member of the castle community, I hope that our clan members will become strong and powerful.<br>
You, you must put in the time required to train and practice. Improve yourself so that we may rely on you to protect yourself and the clan.<br>
(This quest is for characters level 90 or above.)
