What did you say?! You saw a wounded soldier still alive? You should have brought him here.<br>
We can't abandon our own here. Right now, it's our priority to save as many of the lost soldiers as possible and bring them back. If you see any, lead them here. Trust me, I'll make it worth the trouble.
