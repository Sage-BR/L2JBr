<html><body>Injured Soldier:<br>
The last thing I remember is jumping from a sinking airship. Then as I was about to be attacked by the monsters of the Seed, I blanked out. I can only remember bits and pieces of what happened, and it's all so terrifying.<br>
When I regained consciousness, I was here. I... don't want to be here anymore. No one should have to be here. I just want to see my family again. This is a hard request to make, but can you take me someplace safe?<br>
