<html><body>Adventurers' Guide:<br>
The springs near Aden are famous across the land. The mineral water there can be used to treat many... health issues, so naturally Walderal sees a market in selling it. Unfortunately, he soon discovered that the baths are not only frequented by us civilized types, but monsters and fiends as well! His workers were attacked and now refuse to come back, which is where you come in.<br>
Walderal needs soldiers to catch and kill <font color="LEVEL">Hot Springs Bandersnatchlings, Hot Springs Buffaloes, Hot Springs Flavas, Hot Springs Atroxspawns, Hot Springs Antelopes, Hot Springs Nepentheses, Hot Springs Yetis, Hot Springs Atroxes, Hot Springs Bandersnatches, and Hot Springs Grendels</font>. And to get his business back on track, collect <font color="LEVEL">40 Hot Springs Water Samples</font> from each. Easy enough, right?<br>
