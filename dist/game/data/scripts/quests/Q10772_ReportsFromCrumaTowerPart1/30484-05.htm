Even if you don't write a letter, the owl will find your recipient and deliver your message.<br>
You don't have to worry about your letter getting lost or the owl being caught by a hunter or a predator. Cool, right?<br>
The only thing you have to be careful about is not thinking about anything else while thinking about your message, or the messages may cross.<br>
That's one setback, but the Magic Owl is otherwise a good method for sending messages. Would you like to try using one?<br>
