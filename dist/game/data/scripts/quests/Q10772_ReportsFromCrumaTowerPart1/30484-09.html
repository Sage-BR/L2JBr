<html><body>Ivory Tower Wizard Janssen:<br>
Come back any time if you need a Magic Owl. I will gladly lend one to you.<br>
Also, if you change your mind and decide to meet with the Ancient Giant, go and talk to one of my wizards, Rombel. He's very knowledgeable when it comes to the Ancient Giants, so he'll be of much help. Good-bye.
