A Magic Owl is a magical animal in the form of an owl.<br>
I use it to send messages to people in far off places.<br>
People use birds to send messages all the time, but a Magic Owl works a bit differently. You don't need to write an actual letter.<br>
Place your hand over the owl's head and think of your message and it will be conveyed to the owl.<br>
