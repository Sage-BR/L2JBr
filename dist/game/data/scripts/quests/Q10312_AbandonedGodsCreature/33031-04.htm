Meep! Thank all that sparkles! What a weight off my shoulders! If this was left in the hands of those nincompoop watchmen any longer, Apherus would be sure to escape.<br>
The first thing you'll need to do is to take the prison key from the Apherus watchmen. They probably won't be thrilled to part with it, so you may have to be... convincing. Once you've got the key, enter the prison and defeat Apherus! Ooh! And bring the Giant Stem of Apherus back to me when you're done!
