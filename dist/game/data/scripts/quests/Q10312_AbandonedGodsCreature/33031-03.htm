If that beast breaks its chains, it will rampage through Magmeld and the Cats like it's stomping on bugs! I've totally lost faith in the watchmen. They never do anything but play cards and goof off. I totally wouldn't put it past them to release Apherus for a few Adena or sparkly gems. <br1>
Can you and your friends help? If you defeat Apherus before those chains break, we can avoid a lot of bloodshed and grief.<br>
