Well, the problem is mental fatigue. Those chains holding Apherus were forged hundreds of years ago and surprise, surprise, they're starting to weaken. NOT good. I'm not sure if Apherus' Watchers are aware of the problem. You'd think so. If I've noticed, surely they have? Right? I mean, if those chains break and Apherus escapes, Magmeld would be in for some major pain. Meow!<br>
