The enemy are Varka Silenos soldiers.<br>
Their camps are positioned to prevent access to the dragon. It will be impossible to sneak past them.<br>
By facing and defeating them, however, you can obtain a scroll needed to enhance the Spear of Silenos.<br>
Then and only then will you be ready to face Latana, the Dragon of Fire!
