Know that, even wounded, the Dragon of Fire is very powerful. To help you slay him and set his spirit free, use this <font color="LEVEL">Spear of Silenos</font>, which we captured from our enemy. Its power has not reached its full potential, but by defeating the Varka Silenos you can obtain items necessary to enhance its power. Use it to destroy our enemy and send Latana's spirit to the World of Fire!<br>
