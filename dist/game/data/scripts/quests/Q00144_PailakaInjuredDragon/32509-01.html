Dejakar Oroka!<br>
You hold the Spear of Silenos! Your coming was foretold.<br>
But Latana's power is very strong, and the Spear of Silenos is not yet strong enough.<br>
If you have the Scroll of Enchant Weapon made with the blood of Silenos, I will perform a sacred ceremony to enhance the spear!<br>
If you wish, I can also bestow on you some of our tribe's powerful enhancement magic!<br>
