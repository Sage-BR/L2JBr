It is a darkness without shape or substance.<br>
It came from across the sea, and now spreads its black shadow over our land as well.<br>
The Humans call the source of the darkness "Kamaloka" and shadow it casts "Pailaka." Now even our great protector is helpless before it!<br>
We must summon all our strength to defeat the darkness!<br>
