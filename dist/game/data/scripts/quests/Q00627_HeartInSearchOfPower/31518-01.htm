<html><body>Mysterious Necromancer:<br>
You don't look like a pilgrim. Perhaps you could help me with something while you're here?<br>
I'm trying to create a new chimera. I've managed to get some ingredients, such as vampire blood, ogre muscle, and the like.<br>
But I traveled here to look for something completely new. I'm interested in the Gem of Saints, but it's not easy hunting alone.<br>
Please do refrain from looking at me that way. I think they're better off when improving the lives of mortals than rotting underground. <br>
