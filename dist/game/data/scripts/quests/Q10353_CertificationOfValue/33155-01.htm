Well it looks like you can handle yourself in a fight. But then again, that isn't saying much.<br>
Now don't get all wound up about it... I'm not the one that called out the monster, I just stayed canceled in the shadows seeing how well you guys performed.<br>
The name is Rieyi, in case you didn't know, and I am a member of Krasis. Seeing how you performed against that creature I was curious to see if you would be interested in doing some work for us.<br>
