We want to explore the connection between Elder and present the great disasters. For this purpose, we need to investigate
<font color="LEVEL"> the Tower of Insolence </ font>, which is confined to the gods who challenged Baium. However, our organization
operates in secret, so that we can not openly do research.<br>
For this reason, we are recruiting mercenaries who can do the work for us. Of course, Krumas
guarantee fee, so on your part will not be any loss.<br>
