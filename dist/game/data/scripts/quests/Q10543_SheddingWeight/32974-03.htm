At the center of the village, you'll find Warehouse Keeper <font color="LEVEL">Wilford</font>. He isn't the only one, and you'll find Warehouse Keepers throughout the Aden Continent. Make friends with them, and they'll prove useful to you.<br>
I'm going to deposit my rookie training log with Wilford. Would you take it to him? Say hi to him and introduce yourself while you're at it. I'll be waiting for you to return, then.
