I told you about the items needed, right? Well, of course you need items for augmenting too. First, you need equipment you want to augment. It can be a <font color="LEVEL">weapon, accessory, or a hair accessory</font>. You also need <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font>. And you need Gemstones to pay the fee for augmenting, and the amount depends on the weapon grade.<br>
A good way to get the items I mentioned is by using the <font color="LEVEL">private store</font>. There are many merchants who buy and sell items in the village, and you can get the items you want without having to pay fees and stuff. There's some legwork... but it can be fun too!<br>
