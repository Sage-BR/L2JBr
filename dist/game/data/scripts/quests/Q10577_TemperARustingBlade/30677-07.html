Congratulations. Feel free to toss this practice weapon, if you don't like the result. That's what practice is for. In the real world, if you don't like the final version, you can <font color="LEVEL">remove augmentation</font> with some Adena. Keep that in mind.<br>
Anyway, you did a good job following my instructions.<br>
