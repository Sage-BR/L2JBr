I do not know why you have come,<br>
but I really have no time for idle chatter. Since this place is outside the protection of the lord, it has fallen on my shoulders as the captain to recruit sufficient volunteers to defend us from the monsters. We are always short-handed . . .<br>
Unless you have some matter of pressing business, I must bid you good day.
