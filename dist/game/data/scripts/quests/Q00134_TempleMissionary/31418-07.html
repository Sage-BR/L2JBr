Uh...perhaps I've said too much.<br>
I do not know why the Temple is interested in the ancient Giants' technology.<br>
Perhaps it is simply in order to keep it away from the traitors, or to counter its effects should it fall into the wrong hands.<br>
How can I understand the subtle strategies of the Temple's leaders?<br>
In any case, please pass this report to Priestess Glyvka.<br>
