We serve Einhasad, the goddess of light, order and power.<br>
Eons ago, Einhasad imprisoned Shilen, the evil goddess of death. She also destroyed the Giants, who in their arrogance and corruption sought to dethrone the gods themselves.<br>
The people of this continent long served Einhasad in faithfulness and righteousness.<br>
Recently, however, we have encountered signs that Shilen's influence is again growing: groups of disciples devoted to preparing her return, and hordes of monsters that have invaded the peaceful regions of our land.<br>
In this age of rival warlords and ambitious adventurers, the chaos necessary for evil to prevail is all too prevalent.<br>
It is our task to use all our resources to preserve order and carry out Einhasad's will.<br>
