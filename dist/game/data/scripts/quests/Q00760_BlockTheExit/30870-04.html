I'll tell you again. Please don't let them use Aden as an exit. Go to Nightmare Kamaloka and defeat <font color="LEVEL">Tracker Mino, Ill-fated Princess Sola, Fallen Angel Ariar, and Confined Princess Sirra</font>, in that order. Lastly, defeat <font color="LEVEL">Betrayed Dark Rider</font>.<br>
The monsters in Nightmare Kamaloka won't be easy to defeat, so make sure to take your friends with you. I won't say thanks until you come back safe and sound.
