Do you know about <font color="LEVEL">Nightmare Kamaloka</font>? It's a place for those who had to leave their homes, waiting for the right moment to go back.<br>
The way to Nightmare Kamaloka is very dangerous and it changes every time, so it's not just for anyone. The reason why people still went though, is because it was a safe place.<br>
Most of those people were fugitives or those whose lives were threatened.<br>
