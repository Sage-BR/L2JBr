Those creatures in Nightmare Kamaloka have been trying to come out to Aden. That's why we had to plan a battle there. The difference in the dimensions is making it difficult, though. It's because they keep appearing out from the other dimensions, even if we get rid of them.<br>
We have to defeat the creatures from each of the dimensions. In order to do that, we need the help of as many adventurers as possible. Thanks for listening to me.<br>
