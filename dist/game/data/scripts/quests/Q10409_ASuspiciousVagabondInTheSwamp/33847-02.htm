We staked it out. Until we saw a lone figure. We thought the <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious Vagabond</font> was alone, you see. But his comrades hid in the <font color="LEVEL">Swamp of Screams</font>. They slaughtered us. And if it hadn't been for the <font color="LEVEL">Golden Ram Army</font> here, I wouldn't have made it either... Wounded as I am. Will you find that vile vagabond for me? Please.<br>
