Good, I like young people with courage and determination! <font color="LEVEL">Guard Vent</font> is heading up the search party for Sakum.<br>
He's already over at <font color="LEVEL">Windmill Hill</font>. <br>
Lucky for you, you're able to teleport directly to Windmill Hill from here. Just arrange for the teleport with the <font color="LEVEL">gatekeeper</font> at the middle of town. When you arrive, tell Vent that I sent you. I will reward you for the hard work.
