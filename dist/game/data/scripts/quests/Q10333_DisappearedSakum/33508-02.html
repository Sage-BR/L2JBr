Suspicious marks? Oh, the strange markings on the spiders? I mean, they've always been venomous, but lately it's been out of control. I got bitten by one a few days ago, and I noticed some kind of strange mark, but I was too busy running for my life to get a good look.<br>
Hmm... Yes, now that I've gotten a good look, it looks like this mark means the spiders are linked to <font color="LEVEL">Sakum</font>.<br>
