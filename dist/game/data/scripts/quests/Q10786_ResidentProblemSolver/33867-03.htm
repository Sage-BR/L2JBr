I'm trying to make sure another disaster doesn't happen in the Fields of Massacre. Also, I'm here to warn adventurers to stay out of danger. It may seem like a small job, but I'm doing my best to stop disasters from  happening again.<br>
Which is why I'm always watching my back and watching the adventurers. But I'm worried that I may neglect my duty while looking for the document.<br>
