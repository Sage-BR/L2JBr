I have no hidden motive. You and I share a common goal. And THAT makes us partners. You are most honored by it... Have you figured out how to withstand her deadliest magic? As partners, I'll tell you. Use frozen core, and her eternal blizzard magic will feel like a slushy. Wait until Freya casts that magic, and then use the frozen core right away.
