Well, those frozen cores I mentioned can make that deadly magic feel like a soft winter snow. Next time you fight her, wait until she tries to cast the spell and immediately use the frozen core when you start to feel the cold. Ah, I wish I could see the look on her face when her power proves useless. And that's how the Great Sirra will bring about the end of Freya's reign!
