<html><body>Josephina's Companion Izael:<br>
Oh! When you say his name like that... you should be more respectful! Lots of people asking questions about him these days, so now I am the one who's curious.<br>
How do people know Josephina's name without knowing who he is? Find that out for me, and I will answer all your questions.<br>
Try asking <font color="LEVEL">Cas</font>, who's on patrol over there.
