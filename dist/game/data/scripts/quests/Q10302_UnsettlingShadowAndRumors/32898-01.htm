Being here, with all of these strangers, it's very draining. I try to talk to people, but they just ignore me. You'd think I was a leaper of something. Humph! So I just stand here, eavesdropping on conversations. Trying to come up to speed on the local stories and gossip.<br>
It seems like there are a lot of stories here in Magmeld, but I'm beginning to think I'll never hear any of them from start to finish... just tiny snippets here and there. Sigh.<br>
