Oh this is... I don't know where you're planning to use this, but I've never seen an order like yours before...<br>
And it's for an extremely powerful...<br>
It will be difficult, but I think I can make it according to your instructions.<br>
Ah...but there's one thing missing from the list of ingredients.<br>
I need <font color="LEVEL">5 Glass Jaguar Crystals</font> to complete your order.<br>
You know, I'm very interested in new magic myself...<br>
If you bring me <font color="LEVEL">5 Glass Jaguar Crystals</font>, I will craft the empty Sealbook for free.<br>
The Glass Jaguar is an evil spirit that appears in the shape of a shining leopard on the <font color="LEVEL">Plains of Dion</font>.
