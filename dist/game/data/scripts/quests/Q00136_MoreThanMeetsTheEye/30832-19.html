<html><body>Hardin:<br>
(Hardin draws something and begins writing in the empty Book of Seal. Once finished, he casts some sort of spell on the Book of Seal, which flashes for a moment.)<br>
Now take this Book of Seal to <font color="LEVEL">Avant-Garde, the Transformation Wizard on the 2nd floor of the Ivory Tower</font> and you should be able to effect a transformation.<br>
My thanks -- you are a valuable assistant!<br>
Since I am as generous as I am brilliant, I also wish you to take this...<br>
Now I can plunge myself into research for a more varied kind of transformation magic.<br>
Farewell!
