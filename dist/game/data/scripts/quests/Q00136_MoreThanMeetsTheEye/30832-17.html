(As soon as you drink the liquid, you feel stabbing pain inside your head. You can't seem to pull yourself together; you feel as though you are seeing the world from two perspectives, almost as through a mirror. Everything is spinning. Something fundamental in your soul feels like it is changing... You perceive Hardin as though at the end of a long tunnel. He is chanting an incantation... Time passes, and the world seems to steady as you come back to your senses.)<br><br>
Success! Success!<br>
You have done well, my young subject!<br>
Now your soul is in a state in which you can endure transformations.<br>
Excellent!<br>
