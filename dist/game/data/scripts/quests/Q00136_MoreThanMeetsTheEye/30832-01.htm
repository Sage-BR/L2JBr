Among Shilen's creatures, there are those who are able to change their appearance to terrorize and attack people.<br>
As a Necromancer, I am naturally very interested in such abilities. What if their power could be utilized as a kind of magic?<br>
...<br>
Why do I research transformation magic?<br>
At the core, it is because I am curious about lifeforms and knowledge -- I want to understand all knowledge, power and magic under the sun.<br>
Ha ha...<br>
...<br>
Hmm...<br>
Actually, this <font color="LEVEL">Transformation Magic</font> is almost complete.<br>
...<br>
But in order to transform, the soul must first be prepared.<br>
I am still researching that final component... Frankly, I could use some assistance.<br>
