<html><body>Dimensional Pursuer Beloa:<br>
See, the monsters here didn't respond much to attacks from the guards at Aden Castle or the Ivory Tower Wizards are reacting strangely to adventures who have come here to take part in the suppression operation.<br>
You might say they're revealing their true selves, much like snakes molting.<br>
What I mean is, if you find in the Lillim, Nephilim or Gigantics that appear here the dimensional monsters that appear here the dimensional monsters that correspond to their main bodies, 
that can prove that because of the Dimensional Rift that has appeared here, this place is on longer the Catacomb of the Witch!<br>
