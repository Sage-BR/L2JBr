<html><body>Dia:<br>
Weren't you and your fox inseparable back in the Wind Spirit Realm? I don't know if it's good or bad that you're here alone.<br>
But don't worry -- our fates are tied to our foxes. You'll find your fox again someday.<br>
I heard that other Ertheia found their foxes again once they regained their abilities. Stay strong until that day arrives for you as well!<br>
