The ghosts around here seem to have calmed down. I want you to now go and investigate the Forest of the Dead. There's no place as strange.<br>
The longer I'm here, the more curious I become about this place, but my mission doesn't lie in that path.<br>
So, will you go to the Forest of the Dead in my place?<br>
