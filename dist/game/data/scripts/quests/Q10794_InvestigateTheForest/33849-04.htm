I want you to help me with two things.<br>
The first thing is to fell all the Undead in the Forest of the Dead.<br>
The countless number of the Undead in the area is a testament to the horror of the massacre that occurred there.<br>
Another thing is to investigate the tombstones on the south side of Cursed Village.<br>
Don't you think it's interesting that there are tombstones and no one around to venerate them? I think that's well worth investigating.<br>
