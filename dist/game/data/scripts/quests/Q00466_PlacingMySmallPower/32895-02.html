The trees of the Fairy Settlement will need <font color="LEVEL">Timiniel's Tonic</font> if they're to have any chance to fight off the poison. The reason that the trees of Fairy Settlement are okay is all thanks to Timiniel's Tonic, see?<br>
My heart aches when I look at Elven Hierarch Asterios, because he reminds me so much of myself, and while I am glad that I can help yuo, you must know that collecting Timiniel's Tonic is extremely dangerous. Are you ready?<br>
