<html><body>Hierarch Asterios:<br>
The Decaying Darkness is driving Fairies in the Fairy Settlement wild and violent, and also making the cocoons that produce those wild Fairies grow even larger.<br>
However, the trees growing there still retain their mystique and fantastic features.<br1>
It's because Fairy Hierarch <font color="LEVEL">Noeti Minirede</font> has been looking after the trees in the Fairy Settlement using <font color="LEVEL">Timiniel's Tonic</font>.<br>
I would like you to go to Noeti Minirede and ask for some of that tonic.
