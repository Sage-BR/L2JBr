<html><body>Hierarch Asterios:<br>
It all started after the <font color="LEVEL">Rain of Blood</font>. You've heard of <font color="LEVEL">Shilen</font>? Yes?<br>
Well, after Mother Tree fell sick, we heard about the Supernal Light that protects Magmeld and thought that perhaps it might be used to restore Mother Tree. But what I've discovered is that <font color="LEVEL">Agahel</font>, the king of Catastrophe, has awakened. And there's a terrible <font color="LEVEL">Decaying Darkness</font> oozing out from him, sickening all it touches! Troubles upon troubles!<br>
Still, there is hope.<br1>
If we can save Mother Tree, she may be able to vanquish this spreading darkness. Would you help?<br>
