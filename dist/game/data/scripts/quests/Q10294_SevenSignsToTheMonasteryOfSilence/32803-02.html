<html><body>Relic Guardian:<br>
Kaerun didn't want his memoirs published, he was afraid of the chaos they might cause. But if you're qualified, you can enter under the protection of Solina, or under Kaerun's wishes. If you bring all four memoirs, hidden in every direction from here, I'll allow you to take Kaerun's Memoir and leave.
