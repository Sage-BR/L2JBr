<html><body>Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:<br>
The path to Abbot's Room from the Monastery of Silence means there is a teleporter hidden somewhere inside the main room connected to the library. We should find that teleporter. Get ready and we'll leave for the Monastery of Silence. <br>
We might find something if we search the back of library. I'll need some time to get ready, you should go searching without me and I'll catch up later.
