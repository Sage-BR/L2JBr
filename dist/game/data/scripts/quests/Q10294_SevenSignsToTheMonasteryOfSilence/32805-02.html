In all 4 directions, one piece of Kaerun's Memoir is stored. <br>
If you're qualified, you'll know the contents of the book. <br>
Place your hand on the reading desks where the memoirs are located, in the order of the story. <br>
If the order of contents are correct for that reading desk, it will illuminate. <br>
If the order is incorrect, you will be considered an intruder and you will be expelled.
