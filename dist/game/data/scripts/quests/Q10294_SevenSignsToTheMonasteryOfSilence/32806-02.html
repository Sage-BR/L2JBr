<html><body>Relic Watcher:<br>
One piece of Kaerun's Memoir is stored in all 4 directions. If qualified, you'll know the contents of the book. <br>
Place your hand on desk where the memoirs are located in the order of the story. <br>
If the order of contents are correct, that desk will illuminate. <br>
Of course, if the order is incorrect, you will be considered an intruder and watchers will come to expel you.
