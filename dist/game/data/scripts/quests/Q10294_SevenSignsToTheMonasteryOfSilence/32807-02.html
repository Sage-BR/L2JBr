<html><body>Relic Watcher:<br>
In all 4 directions a piece of Kaerun's Memoir is stored. If you're truly qualified, you'll know the contents of the book. <br>
Place your hand on the reading desks with the memoirs, in the order of the story. <br>
If the order of contents are correct, that desk will glow like a bride. <br>
But if the order is incorrect, you will be expelled.
