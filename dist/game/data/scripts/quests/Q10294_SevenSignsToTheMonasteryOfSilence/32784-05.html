<html><body>Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:<br>
We were looking for information from the book we found in Rune's Library. There was a cryptic phrase, "At the large path to the library, turn the outer block of the Monastery, you will find a device to the Abbot's Room,"  written in special ink. We have to find that teleport device.<br>
Go get ready, we leave for the Monastery of Silence. We might find something if we search the back of the library. You go first and start searching, I'll go as soon as I'm ready.
