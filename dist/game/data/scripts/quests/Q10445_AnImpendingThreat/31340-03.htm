<html><body>Captain Mathias:<br>
The Noble Orcs and Orc Supervia have called a ceasefire. But the Nerva Orcs who decided not to work for Orc Supervia still have a grudge, not just against Noble Orcs, but all other races that entered into a nonaggression treaty.<br>
They've settled in a place we call <font color="LEVEL">Raider's Crossroads</font>, and have been threating anyone who comes near them.<br>
Surely you've become quite skilled after all the battles you've seen. Would you be willing to help His Majesty in this?<br>
