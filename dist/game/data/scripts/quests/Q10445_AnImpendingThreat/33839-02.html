Mathias, huh? Well, don't take my ribbing too seriously then. If I don't sound mean, I can't drive the cowards who don't belong here away. Not like you.<br>
Let's have a look... This is a letter from Kakai the Lord of Flame. I see. We cannot handle the situation on our own anymore.<br>
I am very happy that you will work with us strong <font color="LEVEL">Noble Orcs</font>.<br>
Now that you're in on this, I will give you a <font color="LEVEL">Reinforcements' Badge</font> as a token of partnership. Now, go meet <font color="LEVEL">Flame Patrol Warrior Bruener</font> at the entrance to Raider's Crossroads.<br>
