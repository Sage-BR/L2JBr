<html><body>Captain Mathias:<br>
You will pass by a place called <font color="LEVEL">Gainak</font> before you get to Raider's Crossroads. <font color="LEVEL">Flame Patrol Vice Captain Tuska</font> is deployed there under orders from Kakai the Lord of Flame. However, because that place is so far away from Kakai, they exchange letters through a guard from the Town of Rune. But the guard has been injured, and their communications have been cut off. I'd like you to deliver this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Flame Patrol Vice Captain Tuska</font> near <font color="LEVEL">Gainak</font>.
