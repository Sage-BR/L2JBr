Can't you see him? It's <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Watchman Gilmore</font>, right next to me. He's a member of the so-called <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Watchmen</font>. He is one of 12 members here to observe Antharas. He even submitted to the curse that transforms one into an Undead in order to observe the dragon.<br>
I'm a complete newbie compared to him.<br>
