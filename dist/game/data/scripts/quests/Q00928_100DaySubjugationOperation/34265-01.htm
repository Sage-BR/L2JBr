<html><body>Dimensional Researcher Lias:<br>
What brings you here? The Catacomb of the Witch used to be here, but it's not the Catacomb of the Witch of old anymore. It you were trying to get to the Catacomb of the Witch, you're in the wrong place.<br>
Aden Castle, where they were regularly observing the catacombs and necropolis, told us, the Ertheia, that a Dimensional rift has appeared here.<br>
There was a treaty that the Ertheia had entered into with the other races. I'm here to investigate the Dimensional Rift that has appeared here.<br>
Well, since news has gotten out about the Dimensional Rift or Gap or what not, I'm guessing that's what brought you here, but... You wouldn't be here to help us with the operation to suppress the Dimensional Rift, would you?<br>
