You see, you can create a Tiat's Charm with multiple <font color="LEVEL">Tiat's Totems</font> taken from the Dragonkin! You just bring me the totems, and and I'll give you 1 <font color="LEVEL">Tiat's Charm</font> for 5 of them. <br>
But don't bring me tiny little amounts, ok? Bring at least 50 at a time or something. Also, don't try to get more than 500, because I can't accommodate stuff like that.
