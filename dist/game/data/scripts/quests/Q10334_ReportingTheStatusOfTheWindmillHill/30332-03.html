Curses! That roving monster is rampaging through Gludio territory. We're going to have to take it down. Unfortunately we won't gain much from the task, but it's got to be done. <br>
I've been told that it was spotted over near Windmill Hill, towards the Ruins of Despair. We're going to need to send soldiers to the ruins right away!<br>
Anyways, thanks a lot. I'll let you know when I need your help again.
