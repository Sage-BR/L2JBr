You've returned! Seeing as how the Dimensional Energy in you has changed, I'm guessing you've defeated Makkum! Amazing! I knew you'd succeed, Igoodboyl! Truly awesome.<br>
I've had these lying around to give one you when you slay Makkum and return. I'm sure they'll prove helpful. Choose the one you like!<br>
