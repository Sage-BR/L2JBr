Wow! Would you take a look see how much the Dimensional Traces accumulated! HaargI mean, you were building up so much of them, I knew there was something special about you, but wow, I never expected it to be so much!<br>
You did know how much of the Dimensional Traces you picked up, didn't you?<br>
With this much, we'll be able to make it to the depths of the Dimensional Rift! If what I suppose to be true is right, who we'll find there is Makkum!<br>
