<html><body>Dimensional Researcher Lias:<br>
The place where Makkum lies in hidden is so secret and hidden that even using the power emanating from the <font color="LEVEL">100 Dimensional Traces</font> you currently 
have will get just one person - you - there. Still, since Makkum has not yet recovered fully, I trust that if anyone were to be able to find and take advantage of any weaknesses he currently has, it's you!<br>
But don't let down your guard! Makkum is going to attack you at cost, even if it means sacrificing himself. Be as careful as you can in order to survive the battle.<br>
Remember, Makkum needs to be <font color="LEVEL">defeated within 7 minutes</font>! if you find yourself unable to defeat Makkum when 7 minutes have passed, you'll need to get out of there at any cost. Be sure to take along a <font color="LEVEL">Blessed Escape</font> with you.<br>
If you're ready to go to see Makkum, tell me.<br>
