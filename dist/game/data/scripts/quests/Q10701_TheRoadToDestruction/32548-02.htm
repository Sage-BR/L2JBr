The Seed of Destruction is west of my base. It's ruled by <font color="LEVEL">Tiat</font>, Lord of the Dragonkin and a follower of Shilen.<br>
Tiat is kin to the <font color="LEVEL">Dark Dragon</font>. Wizards tell us that when Tiat appeared on the land through the Seed, all kinds of crazy started happening -- dead dragons' souls were given bodies, and monsters took the form of Dragonkin. The Seed of Destruction is now a swarming with such creatures.<br>
