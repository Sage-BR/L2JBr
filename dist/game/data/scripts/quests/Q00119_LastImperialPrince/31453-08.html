Please, go to Rune Township and meet with Nurse Devorin so you can learn the lyrics of the lullaby! Show her the Antique Brooch so she'll know that I sent you. Please... Help!<br>
... What? You don't have the brooch? I must've made a mistake. I'm sorry!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">(The Antique Brooch is essential to this quest. Try again after you obrain it. This quest is terminated.)
