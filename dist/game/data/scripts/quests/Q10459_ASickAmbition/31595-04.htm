The Wormhole activates when Beleth appears; use it to go to the heart of Hellbound. There we will face and defeat <font color="LEVEL">Beleth</font> together! If nothing else, we must at least take down <font color="LEVEL">Darion</font>, his right-hand man. <br>
If it is the will of you and your fellow warriors, I will also join the battle.
