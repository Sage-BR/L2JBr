Here. Now use this Scroll: Enchant Weapon (R-grade) to enchant it. I'll give you a certificate if you can enchant it up to <font color="LEVEL">+7</font>.<br>
Just letting you know, the <font color="LEVEL">Lady's Ornamental Silver Knife</font> has no value. If you ever lose it, I can provide you with another <font color="LEVEL">Lady's Ornamental Silver Knife</font>.
