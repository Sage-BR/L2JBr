There's something called <font color="LEVEL">Dark Atelia Neutralizer</font>. That alleviates the pain I feel a little. The Embryo carry that neutralizer, but it's hard to get. <br>
If you really are here because Elikia sent you to help me, defeat <font color="LEVEL">150</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">Fortress Guardian Captains, Fortress Raiders, Atelia Passionate Soldiers, and Atelia Elite Captains</font>. Also, I would appreciate it if you could get me <font color="LEVEL">10 Dark Atelia Neutralizers</font>.
