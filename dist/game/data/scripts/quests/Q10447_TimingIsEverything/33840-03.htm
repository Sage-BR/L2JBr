I don't think this is always the case but... <font color="LEVEL">Nerva's Temporary Prison</font> is a bit strange right now. Detainees get violent after a while. Maybe there's some kind of aura there or something. Well, if you want, you can just open the door for him and come back. Our goal is to cut off the source of money for the Nerva Orc military, not lose fine friends like you!<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Nerva Orcs</font> should have a <font color="LEVEL">Nerva's Temporary Prison Key</font>. Kill them to get it.<br>

'Timing is key!'
