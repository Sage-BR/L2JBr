Thank you. Just wait here a moment...<br>
Here's the Spider Silk you requested. Radia had actually asked for other materials as well, but you seem capable of finding enough. She needs <font color="LEVEL">420 Low-grade Armor Fragments and 750 Low-grade Accessory Gems</font>. Easy enough for you, right?
