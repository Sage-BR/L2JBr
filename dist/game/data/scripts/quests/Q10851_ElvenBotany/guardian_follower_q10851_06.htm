Ah, so will you help me out?<br>
If that's the case, the samples I need are... oh, I guess you don't exactly how many of which samples I'll be needing, since Irene was the one who was managing the samples.<br>Would you go to Irene and ask which samples required for the research are?<br>
See, I've been bugging Irene with a bunch of questions, even just now... I think it would be better for you to go and ask instead of me.
