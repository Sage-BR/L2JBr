I was wondering what Celestiel was talking so enthusiastically about. I guess you were talking about the samples.<br>
I swear she told me just a short while ago that she needed some kind of sample... Well, with her being as busy as she is nowadays with her research, her being so forgetful is understandable.<br>
Samples needed are <font color="LEVEL">150 Apherus Samples, and 50 Flower Bud Samples</font>. Samples can be obtained from <font color="LEVEL">Apherus, and Flower Buds</font>.
