I am Celestiel. I have come here with Irene in search of a way to save the Mother Tree.<br>
I know how to do bits and pieces of many things. I'm usually studying changes in the plants and the soil here, but I need more samples for my research. That's why I'm asking you for help.<br>
I've been searching for the samples firsthand until now, but it's been taking me so long that I've been falling behind on my research. I have no choice but to dedicate myself to research while having somebody else hunt around for samples.<br>
