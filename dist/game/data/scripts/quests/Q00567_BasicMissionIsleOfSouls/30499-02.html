Are you here on a mission from the Adventure Guild? I've seen many who are. If so, I'll explain the details.<br>
You'll have to select <font color="LEVEL">Dark Elf Village</font> from the teleport link I give you and go there. The area for an active mission will appear <font color="LEVEL">at the top of the teleport list</font> so it won't be hard to find.<br>
But you have to watch out for one thing.<br>
