<html><body>Watcher of Valakas Klein:<br>
Would you look at that... a real Lavasaurus Alpha fragment.<br>
Give me a moment while I add this to the pile of Lavasaurus Alpha fragments all the other adventurers brought me... what? Oh, that's right. I said I would make you something with it.<br>
Well, I've got to be honest here... I didn't think you, or any of the others, would actually be successful. What little magic I was able to extract I can put into small objects, such as this scroll. This will bring you back here any time in an instant... but don't expect much more out of it.<br>
Why would you want to come back here? I don't know... maybe because Valakas seems to come back to life every couple of weeks.<br>
I need people like you so I can stay in business.
