<html><body>Lakcis:<br>
I'm confident I know the Ruins of Ye Sagira better than any seeker. I've studied really hard, you see.<br>
I want you to speak to <font color="LEVEL">Chesha</font> in Ruins of Ye Sagira <font color="LEVEL">Exploration Area 1</font>, and tell her that "Lakcis is ready to go to ruins whenever".<br>
Now, to get inside, I believe you can use the <font color="LEVEL">Ye Sagira Teleportation Device</font>. Go, and be safe!<br>
