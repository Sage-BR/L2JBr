Please kill <font color="LEVEL">10 Husk Stalkers</font> and <font color="LEVEL">10 Husk Crawlers</font> in Exploration Zone 1.<br>
The space beyond the crevice is connected only to the bluish path. Remember that.<br>
At the end of this area should be a teleport device to Exploration Zone 2. Nagel, who is in charge of there, should be here, scared out of his mind. Once you're done with your slaying, please go and comfort Nagel.
