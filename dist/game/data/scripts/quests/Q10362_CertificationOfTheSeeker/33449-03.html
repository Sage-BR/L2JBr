Good. I will trust you. As you can see, monsters have been sprouting out of the remains of the corpses of those who fell victim when the Heavenly Island fell out of the sky, strewn nearby the ruins.<br>
Clear up this horrible situation by killing <font color="LEVEL">10 Husk Stalkers</font> and <font color="LEVEL">10 Husk Crawlers</font> in Exploration Zone 1.<br>
The space beyond the crevice is connected only to the bluish path. Remember that.<br>
At the end of this area should be a <font color="LEVEL">teleport device to Exploration Zone 2</font>. <font color="LEVEL">Nagel</font>, who is in charge of there, should be here, scared out of his mind. Once you're done with your slaying, please go and comfort Nagel.
