I know that Elikia is worried, but I must carry out Leona's mission. To do that, I have to recover as soon as possible and find out what the Embryo are up to. <br>
Can you buy me some time to recover and go kill <font color="LEVEL">250 Atelia Passionate Soldiers, Atelia Elite Captains, Atelia High Priests, Fortress Archons, and Atelia Flame Masters</font>?<br>
We should be able to keep the stronghold safe and I'll have more time to recover. I'm counting on you.
