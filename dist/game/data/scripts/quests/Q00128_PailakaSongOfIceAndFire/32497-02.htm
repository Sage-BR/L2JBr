The Ivory Tower sent our inspection team to find out what we could about the place.<br>
We followed the flow of mana, tracing the energy of Kamaloka to find likely spots to look.<br>
So far, it seems that Pailaka has not affected our reality, but who knows what may happen as time goes by? It might even impact next year's harvest!<br>
We found Pailaka, it's in the Forgotten Temple, very close to here. If you are willing, I'd like you to enter Pailaka and restore order. Can I trust you to do so?<br>
