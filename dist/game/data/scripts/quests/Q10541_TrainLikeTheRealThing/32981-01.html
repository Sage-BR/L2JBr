<html><body>Adventurers' Guide for Training:<br>
What? Shannon told you to come to me to receive tips on fighting more efficiently? Well this is embarrassing.<br>
Listen, what I have to tell you isn't complicated, but you have to dedicate yourself and awaken the powers that lie within. All I do is give you the small nudge you might need.<br>
I can give you a little bit of help that is going to <font color="LEVEL">protect your body</font>, and allow you to wield <font color="LEVEL">stronger powers</font> when attacking the enemy. In short, you'll be taught how to use <font color="LEVEL">Support Magic/buffs</font>.<br>
I can help if need be. What would you like to do?<br>
