<html><body>Forest Patrol Leira:<br>
Ricky's favorite thing to do was chase Kiku around. I'd scold him, saying that's dangerous, but I would always catch him chasing Kiku anyway.<br>
Cough...This cold just isn't going away. Oh, my, where's my brain? I haven't shown him to you yet.<br>
Would you like to meet Ricky?<br>
