Oh no! Where did Ricky run off to now?<br>
It's dangerous over on that side! The Kikus and Growlers might hurt him. Please go find him. I can't leave my post.<br>
Cough...You'll find him in one of the <font color="LEVEL">3 Kiku's Caves</font> up there. Once you find him, you have <font color="LEVEL">2 minutes</font> to bring him back to me. Ricky might get restless and run away again.<br>
Do be careful. The Kiku might attack you for rummaging around its cave.
