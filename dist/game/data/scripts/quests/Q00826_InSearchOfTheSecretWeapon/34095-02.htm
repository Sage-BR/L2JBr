<html><body>Refugee Neti:<br>
I've come to Gludio to let people know about this. Strong adventurers will be able to save Gludin.<br>
However, I'm not just asking people for help. I can promise that I have something good to give in return as well.<br>
When I came out of Gludin... I didn't come out empty-handed.<br>
