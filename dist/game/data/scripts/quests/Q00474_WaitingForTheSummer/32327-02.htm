In better days, my friend. In better days. The Frozen Labyrinth area is full of game. <font color="LEVEL">Lost Buffaloes, Frost Buffaloes, Ursus Cubs, Ursuses, Lost Yetis, and Frost Yetis</font> should yield the most meat.<br>
The job calls for <font color="LEVEL">30</font> cuts each of <font color="LEVEL">Buffalo Meat, Ursus Meat, and Yeti Meat</font>. Any questions?<br>
