<html><body>High Priest Gereth:<br>
Are you saying you've never visited Faeron Village while back in the Wind Spirit Realm?<br>
You can think of the tower as being a type of altar.<br>
We were once able to hear Sayha's voice through the alter, but since coming here...<br>
But, even if we can't hear Sayha's voice, it doesn't mean he's abandoned us.<br>
And now, to get you safely settled here, let's pray to Sayha.
