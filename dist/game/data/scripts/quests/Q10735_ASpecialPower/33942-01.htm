Break's over. It's time to begin some earnest training.<br>
We're going to the training camp. The monsters there are illusions based on actual monsters that live outside this town. Practice means getting some real battle experience while overcoming its dangers. I'll be going with you, so don't be scared.<br>
So, are we ready?<br>
