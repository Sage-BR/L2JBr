Regarding the attributes, go to the Attribute Master NPCs in the Town of Aden or Town of Rune. They release the attributes applied to weapons and armor and can also exchange the Attribute Stones. Of course, there is a fee. In addition, they also sell potions that can enhance the attribute for a short period.<br>
Now, let's practice. It won't be difficult. I'll give you a <font color="LEVEL">Attribute Practice Long Sword</font>. So, using the <font color="LEVEL">Practice Attribute Stone</font>, apply an attribute. Are you ready?<br>
