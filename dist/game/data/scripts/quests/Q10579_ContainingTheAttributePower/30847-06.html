Now, let me tell you about how to grant <font color="LEVEL">attributes</font>! First of all, remember that an attribute can only be applied to items with <font color="LEVEL">S-grade and above</font>. The method is the same with Enchantment. <font color="LEVEL">Double-click</font> the <font color="LEVEL">Attribute Crystal</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Attribute Stone</font>.<br>
Only <font color="LEVEL">one</font> attribute can be applied to a Weapon and when you grant an attribute, additional attribute damage can be applied too. Corresponding to the attribute of the monster that you are fighting, the attribute damage can increase or decrease.<br>
On the other hand, you can apply as many as <font color="LEVEL">three</font> attributes to <font color="LEVEL">armor</font>. However, you can't grant conflicting attributes to armor. If you apply an attribute to armor, it will gain the resistance to that attribute. The higher the monsters level is, there is a higher probability it will attack with an attribute. It'll be helpful to know the monsters attribute so you can prepare accordingly. <br>
