The Auction House allows you to sell or buy items through the Auction House NPCs. Therefore, if you use this function, you don't need to be logged into the game when you want to trade the items.<br>
To use this function, find the <font color="LEVEL">Auction House Manager</font> in town. You can open the map to check the location, so it shouldn't be difficult.<br>
A brokerage fee will be deducted after a listed item has been sold.<br>
You can search for items but make sure that the quantity is correct, or you may accidentally buy more than you intended. Anyway, if you get the materials using this method, you'll be ready for leaming about granting attributes.<br>
