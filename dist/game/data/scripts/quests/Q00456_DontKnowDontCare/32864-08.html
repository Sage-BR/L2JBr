As a soul, all I have is time. I'll tell you everything.<br>
Kill them and take the <font color="LEVEL">Essense of Drake Lord</font> from its corpse... the <font color="LEVEL">Behemoth Leader's Essence</font>... And... the <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Beast's Essence</font>... collect them. I will gather my last bit of hatred to cheer you on!<br>
Except you will need many skilled people for this fight - take trustworthy people with you.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">(You cannot collect the quest item if you're not in a party)</font>
