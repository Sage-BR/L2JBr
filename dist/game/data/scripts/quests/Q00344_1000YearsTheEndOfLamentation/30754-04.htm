<html><body>Watcher of Antharas Gilmore:<br>
You probably know as well, but there were many, many people that tried to kill Antharas. None were able, but their death was not the end for all. While some were undoubtedly held by Shilen's grasp, others become Cave Servants. Right now, I don't even know how many Cave Servants exist in the <font color="LEVEL">Watcher's Tomb</font>. What I can ask of you is to destroy as many Cave Servants as possible. <font color="LEVEL">Cave Servant, Archer, Warrior, Chief... Anything that has Cave in the name</font>. Kill them and collect their relics, then bring them to me. I will reward you appropriately.
