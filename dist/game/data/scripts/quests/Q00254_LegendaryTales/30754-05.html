Then prove it with your skills, not words! You'll get a <font color="LEVEL">Large Dragon Bone</font> when you defeat the monsters in this region. Bring the bone to one of the <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Votrexes</font> found in many places in the Dragon Valley, You will meet one of the servant of the land dragon.<br>
Kill a <font color="LEVEL">Emerald Horn, Dust Rider, Bleeding Fly, Black Dagger Wing, Shadow Summoner, Spike Slasher, or a Muscle Bomber</font> and bring their <font color="LEVEL">Large Dragon Skull</font>.<br>
Of course, that means you'd have to kill each of them at least once.
