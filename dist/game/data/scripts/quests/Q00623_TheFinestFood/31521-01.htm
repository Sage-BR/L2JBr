<html><body>Chef Jeremy:<br>
Long ago, the most distinguished aristocrats of the empire came here for their excursions. Those bastards! When I refused to be their personal chef,  they insulted my food! They have no appreciation for haute cuisine!<br>
As hard as they tried, no one could find fault with my food!<br>
Those cretins had the nerve to point out that they weren't served a specialty dish indigenous to this region!<br>
Then and there I resolved to make a dish so indigenous to this region that those barbarians would be silenced once and for all!<br>
But, as I'm sure you're aware, it takes more than ingredients to make a dish.<br>
The monsters in this region are too tough, don't you think?<br>
Will you help me?<br>
