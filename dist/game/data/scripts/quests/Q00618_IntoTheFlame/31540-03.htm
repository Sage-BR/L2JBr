Meet <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Hilda in the Town of Goddard and bring me Vacualite</font>. If a magic power is infused in it, it can activate the magic. It's a very unique mineral, and can only be used once.<br>
With it I can create a <font color="LEVEL">Vacualite Floating Stone</font> to get through the Hall of Flames.
