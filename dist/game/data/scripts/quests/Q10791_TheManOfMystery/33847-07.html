So, this Kain has appeared and helped you again? Pa'agrio always shows the way to outstanding warriors.<br>
Anyway, we know that those Suspicious Cocoons are the root of our problems, and you've gotten rid of a high number of them, so there's no longer a need to worry. Of course, this Kain fellow helped you, but to me, the outcome is all the same.<br>
Thank you for your help.
