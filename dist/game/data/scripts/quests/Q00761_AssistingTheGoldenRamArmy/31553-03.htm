We need <font color="LEVEL">Intact Stakato Talons</font> as well. Like the shells, you can get them from <font color="LEVEL">Stakatos</font>, just not as easily.<br>
I'm sure that by the time you <font color="LEVEL">collect 50 Intact Stakato Shells</font>, you'll figure out the talons as well. I'm offering an additional reward based on the number of talons you bring back.<br>
Sound good?<br>
