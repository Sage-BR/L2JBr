Hmm... Even after <font color="LEVEL">Ketra's Commander Tayr</font> was killed, <font color="LEVEL">Belos</font> didn't show up. I will think on this.

Now that the alliance between <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orcs</font> is proven, it is not good for us to have him alive.<br>
