I'm saying that the lifeforms in this area for the most part have something called Black Ice Crystals inside their bodies. The crystals cause the creatures to become violent, which is why there are a few hunters collecting the crystals for research. If you collect some for them, you'll get a pretty decent reward. Of course, most of the time, you'll find a Silver Ice Crystal rather than a Black Ice Crystal. But even if you bring back some Silver Ice Crystals, you'll still get a reward.<br>
