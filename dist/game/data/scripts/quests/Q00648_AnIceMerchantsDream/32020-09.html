As part of the Jinia Guild's goal to restore Queen Freya to her original self, we needed Silver Hemocytes to enter the Ice Queen's Castle. Now that Ice Fairy Sirra has been defeated and we've entered the next stage in our plan... that is to say, fight Freya herself... we no longer need you to bring Silver Hemocytes to the castle. However, when you're strong enough, come back and talk to me about the Guild's new plans regarding Freya.
