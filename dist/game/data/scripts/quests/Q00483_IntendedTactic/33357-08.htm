I need a blood Monster <font color="LEVEL">Tower of Insolence</font>! It seems that in their blood some hidden secret. All come here to get this blood. I was particularly interested in the newly emerging monsters. <br>
Destroy <font color="LEVEL">Vladimir Voinov, Voinov Radzhuosa, Ken Birestiana, Bistiana, Birestiana, Warrior of the Rainbow Guardian, Guardian Knight of the Rainbow</font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL">10 samples of blood of Allegiance</font>. <br>
It would be great if you are at the same time destroyed their leaders: <font color="LEVEL">Vladimir Radzhuosa, Ken</font>, and brought me to <font color="LEVEL">Blood of Truth</font>!
