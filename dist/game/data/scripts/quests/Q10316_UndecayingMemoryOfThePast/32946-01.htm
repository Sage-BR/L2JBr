From what I can tell, a huge wave of darkness came through here recently and opened a gap between Magmeld and the other dimensions. And, well, it seems like the shock of the wave awoke Spezion's... err... well, consciousness, I guess you'd call it.<br>
He seems to be flickering in and out of consciousness. It's all quiet, then there's motion. Frankly, it's creeping me out!<br>
