Congratulations on your class transfer to <font color="LEVEL">Artisan</font>. I see plenty of challenges and obstacles for you to test yourself against in your future! Knowing your penchant for a good fight, I'm betting you'll enjoy yourself immensely! Hahaha!<br>
Now, scoot! Go see <font color="LEVEL">Lord of Flame Kakai</font>. He's over in the administrative office. He can help guide you onwards. Have fun!
