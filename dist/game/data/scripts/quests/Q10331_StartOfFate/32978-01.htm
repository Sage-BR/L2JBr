This is a dangerous place, and access is restricted. Oh, it's you. Since the deaths, not many have been trying to come to Exploration Area 5. It has me worried.<br>
I haven't been able to investigate, because I'm recovering from an injury, but there've been rumors of strangers going in and out of the area under the labyrinth, and also of suspicious intruders in the Museum. Are these things linked?<br>
