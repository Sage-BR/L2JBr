They showed up quite a while ago. I followed them into the Labyrinth and spied on them a bit.<br>
They were a group of humans who appeared to be members of some secretive organization. They had in their possession a large Evil Fragment... <br>
There was one, who seemed to be the leader, doing some kind of magical ritual on the fragment. Probably trying to hatch it. Can you even imagine what will happen if they manage that? The whole place might collapse again. This is why I sent to town for help, and it seems like you're the one they dispatched. So, what do you say? Will you help me?<br>
