<html><body>Giant's Minion Hansen:<br>
After you mercilessly destroyed <font color="LEVEL">Sakum</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> succeeded in creating 2 clones of the monster: <font color="LEVEL">Belos</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Kampf</font>.<br>
I tracked <font color="LEVEL">Kampf</font> to the <font color="LEVEL">Varka Silenos Barracks</font>. It seems <font color="LEVEL">Varka Silenoses</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> decided to work together and Kampf was handed over in the process. You and I must stop their cooperation.<br>
There is much to be done. As soon as you are ready, let me know.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">- Note: You can develop yourself through quests and hunting at the hunting ground of Varka Silenos Barracks. You can get the next item, Kekropus' Letter, at Lv. 81.</font>
