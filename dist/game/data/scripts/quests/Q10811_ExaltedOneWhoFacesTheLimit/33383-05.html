I'll be seeing whether you have what it takes to become stronger.<br>
First, you must prove that you are capable of using <font color="LEVEL">16 Ability Points</font>. Learn a skill with Ability Points and prove your strength.<br>
Then, pass the tests set by the following people and bring back certificates. The people who will test you are <font color="LEVEL">Verdure Elder Elikia</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Heine</font>, the <font color="LEVEL">Mysterious Butler</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Trader Galladucci</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Giran</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Sir Eric Rodemai</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Aden</font>.<br>
Go talk to them to find out what their tests are about. I'll be waiting for you to return with the certificates. If you forget who you must go to, refer to the guide I'll be giving you.
