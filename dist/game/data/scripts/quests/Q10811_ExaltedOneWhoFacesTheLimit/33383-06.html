Still? I'll explain again, so remember it.<br>
Use <font color="LEVEL">16 Ability Points</font> to learn a skill and prove your strength. After that, pass the tests of the following people and bring back their certificates.<br>
The first people who will test you are <font color="LEVEL">Verdure Elder Elikia</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Heine</font>, the <font color="LEVEL">Mysterious Butler</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Trader Galladucci</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Giran</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Sir Eric Rodemai</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Aden</font>.<br>
Go talk to them to find out what their tests are about. I'll be waiting for you to return with the certificates.
