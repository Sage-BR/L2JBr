<html><body>Cellphine:<br>
Tell me, do you still believe the gods look after you? I am Cellphine. I serve the Giants and despite what you may have heard they are not completely extinct. I serve one who has awoken after thousands of years. I've been searching for one who is able to free him from his imprisonment.<br>
Was it fate that brought you here, or something else? I can sense that you have a power that few possess that could help my master. Will you help free my master from his imprisonment?<br>
