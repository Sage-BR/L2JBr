There is something... strange about you. I am Hadel, a disciple of the great Giant Hermuncus. What brings you to this place? Are you another one of those tomb raiders looking to steal artifacts from the Giants? Speak!<br>
Oh, Cellphine sent you here... then that is what I sense about you. You are here to free my master Hermuncus. I can feel strong and unyielding energy resonating within your soul. Yes, you do seem to have certain strength about you suitable to save the master.<br>
