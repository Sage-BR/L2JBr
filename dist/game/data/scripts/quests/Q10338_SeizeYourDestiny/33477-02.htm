My master is the last Giant... the leader of the Giants... Hermuncus. After the war was lost, the Gods convicted him of stealing their power. His soul was torn from his body and was to spend eternity imprisoned within Ye Sagira. His body was ripped apart and scattered the land. He was to be an example to those who would dare rise against the gods.  Makes me shudder just thinking about it.<br>
Hermuncus soul slept until recently. When Shilen tore Ye Sagira from the sky causing it to crash into this island this act released a seal on his spirit allowing him to call upon those who would help him.<br>
If you help him, it could be possible that he will help you Awaken your true power. You could have the same power that the gods and Giants once had. Will you help free Hermuncus?<br>
