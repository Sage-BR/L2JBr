Even for Giants, there were far too many that were consumed by the power they received. Your inner strength will decide
the final outcome, not my influence.<br>
Take the <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Afterlife</font> to one of the <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Giant statues</font>
in the <font color="LEVEL">Reliquary of the Giants</font>. There you will learn about which Giant hero you wish to
receive your power from and become <font color="LEVEL">Awakened</font>.<br>
When you are ready I will send you there.<br>
