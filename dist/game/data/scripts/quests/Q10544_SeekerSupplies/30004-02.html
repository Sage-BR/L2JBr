<html><body>Grocer Katerina:<br>
I sell <font color="LEVEL">various accessories</font>. I deal in a variety of articles, far too many to name them all. They include <font color="LEVEL">Scrolls of Escape</font>, used to return to the village from outside, <font color="LEVEL">Recovery Potions</font> for use when injured, and <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Spiritshots</font> which are used in battle. They're mostly <font color="LEVEL">consumables</font>.<br>Oh, would you look at that. I've been gossiping again.<br>
Oh, yes! If you have the time, could you deliver Grocery Supply Boxes for me? Please stop by <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Merchant Lector</font> on your way.
