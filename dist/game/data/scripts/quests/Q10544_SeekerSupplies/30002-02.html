Ah, then you must be on your way to deliver supply items!<br>
This is great. I was wondering what I should do, since I can't leave my store unattended. Here's an Armor Supply Box that I'd like you to deliver.<br>
While you're at it, I'd like you to stop by the Accessory Merchant as well. He's also having trouble delivering supply boxes.
