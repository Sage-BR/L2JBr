<html><body>Armor Merchant Jackson:<br>
Would you like to know more about armors?<br> 
I'm Jackson, and I sell <font color="LEVEL">armors</font> that <font color="LEVEL">enhance your defenses against physical attacks</font>.<br>
It's rewarding to be selling articles so directly associated with safety. Equip yourself with <font color="LEVEL">a upper armor, pants, gloves, boots, and a helmet</font>, and you'll be able to withstand strong attacks.<br>
But it appears that you're not here to buy armors.<br>
