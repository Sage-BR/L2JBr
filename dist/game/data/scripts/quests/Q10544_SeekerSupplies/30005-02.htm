<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Wilford:<br>
Aha! You're a quick thinker. Of course, I just stand here and receive articles for safekeeping from passers by, but the traders in the village are hard at work, fighting against the crisis on the continent.<br>

But providing supplies is different from leaving my shop unattended. That's why I'm always looking for manpower to deliver the supplies I donate.<br>
