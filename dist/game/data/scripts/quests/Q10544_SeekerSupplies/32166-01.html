<html><body>Accessory Merchant Trevor:<br>
I have been waiting for you. I saw you meeting the other merchants, and was wondering whether you would make it over here.<br>
You're delivering the Supply Chests, aren't you? I have some accessory supply items prepared.<br>
I deal in accessories such as <font color="LEVEL">earrings, necklaces, and rings</font>. Armor increases defense against physical attacks. On the other hand, <font color="LEVEL">accessories</font> increase <font color="LEVEL">defense against magic</font>. <br>
The enemies outside the village will attack you in various forms, which why it's important to wear both armor and accessories.<br>
