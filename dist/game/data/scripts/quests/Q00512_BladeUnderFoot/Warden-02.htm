<html><body>Prison Warden:<br>
Excellent! I appreciate your offer, friend.<br>
This dungeon prison was only recently discovered, and no one knows its true purpose.<br>
Some legends say that long, long ago, some emperor created this dungeon as a place to secretly breed monsters for magical experiments.<br>
Others say that it was built during the empire's golden age to contain monsters that were pitted against prisoners in gladiatorial fights.<br>
Whatever its purpose, it was sealed and hidden for centuries -- we only recently uncovered the entrance.<br><br>
Well, let's get down to brass tacks. Please defeat the leaders of the <font color="LEVEL">three prisoner gangs</font> that roam the dungeon - <font color="LEVEL">Beautiful Atrielle, Nagen the Tomboy and Jax the Destroyer</font> - and bring me the <font color="LEVEL">monsters' rank badges</font>.<br>
