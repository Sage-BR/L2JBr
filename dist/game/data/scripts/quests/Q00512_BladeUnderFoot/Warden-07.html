<html><body>Prison Warden:<br>
Enter the dungeon prison and slay the prisoners.<br><br>
Wipe out all <font color="LEVEL">3 gangs</font> to eradicate the monsters' entire organization in the dungeon.<br>
When you defeat the leader of the last gang, bring me a Fragment of the Dungeon Leader Mark and I will pay you with a Knight's Epaulette.<br>
If you take it to a Court Wizard, he will exchange it for the castle's clan supply for you.<br>
Ah, one last thing...<br>
The leaders of the monsters are <font color="LEVEL">Beautiful Atrielle, Nagen the Tomboy and Jax the Destroyer</font>.<br>
I can grant you access to the dungeon right now.<br>
Good luck!<br>
