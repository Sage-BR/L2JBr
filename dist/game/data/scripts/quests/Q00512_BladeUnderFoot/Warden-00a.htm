<html><body>Prison Warden:<br>
Thank you for your willingness to help, adventurer; however, I can't put you in danger.<br>
I handle all of the bookkeeping for the castle and the sheer amount of paperwork that I would have to fill out to get permission to put you on our payroll. Oi! Makes me shudder just thinking about it.<br>
 Get some more training, learn mores skills, get some more missions under your belt and then I'll see what I can do to get you certified for a destruction mission.<br>
(This quest is for characters level 90 or above.)
