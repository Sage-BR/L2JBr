<html><body>Prison Warden:<br>
Hmm...<br>
Since the dungeon was abandoned for so long, the prisoners -- monsters all -- eventually formed an independent society.<br>
This basement camp features a very complicated network of secret passageways, which the monsters now use to move at will throughout this dungeon and even to areas of the surface world they inhabit.<br>
And those paths are connected to the areas controlled by the monsters on the surface.<br>
They rule the underground world, which even has its own twisted class structure. Apparently higher-level monsters inhabit the dungeons beneath castles while relatively low-level creatures live beneath fortresses.<br>
