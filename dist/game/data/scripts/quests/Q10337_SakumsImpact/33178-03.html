Tell you what, if all you need is a sketch of Sakum, Guard Lef is a little bit of an artist and has already drawn a pretty good sketch of the creature.<br>
But you need to do a favor for us first. I need you to eliminate some of the creatures around the Ruins of Despair for us. About <font color="LEVEL">15 Skeleton Warriors</font>,<font color="LEVEL">20 Ruin Imps</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">25 Bats</font> should do it.<br>
Once you are done, go see <font color="LEVEL">Guard Lef</font> about getting that sketch.
