Are you still here?<br>
You better plan to head out soon. I'm going to, as soon as I'm off duty. I'm good at this game, so you might want get a head start catching <font color="LEVEL">Skeletal Warriors, Ruin Imps and Bats</font>.<br>
If by some weird quirk of fate, you do manage to catch them all before I do, go check in with <font color="LEVEL">Guard Lef</font>. I bet I'll already have caught a full set of those beasts and be be there with Lef, kicking back, shoot'n the breeze.
