I'm getting tired of Silvan getting others to do his work. I understand that he hasn't slept in days, but still... bad form.<br>
I do have a <font color="LEVEL">sketch of Sakum</font> but I'm afraid that I can't just hand it over to you just for doing Silvan's task. You will need to do something for me first.
