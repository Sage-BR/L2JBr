<html><body>Sir Gustav Athebaldt:<br>
As most do.<br>
But many are not aware of a great battle that bubbles under the surface, between our order and the <font color="LEVEL">Order of Dusk</font>. We fight for control over the <font color="LEVEL">Seven Seals</font>, the seals Shunaiman himself created to fight Shilen and her armies.<br>
These seals are now buried deep in Aden's <font color="LEVEL">catacombs and necropolises</font>, areas which have turned into hellish battlefields.<br>
