Thank you very much. You are indeed an adventurer with a warm heart. I do have good eyes to spot a good person.<br>
Now, you can give me Jacob's necklace. I will have someone take it to the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Oren's</font> <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Hollint in the Temple of Einhasad</font> beforehand.<br>
Also, I'll send your reward for finding Jacob as well as the memorial service to High Priest Hollint. Even though I'm a dwarf, I won't be stingy in showing my appreciation for an adventurer like you.<br>
I am sure you are tired after looking for Jacob. Have a drink of water and go see <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Hollint</font>.<br>
Please take care of the memorial service for Jacob for me. Well done.
