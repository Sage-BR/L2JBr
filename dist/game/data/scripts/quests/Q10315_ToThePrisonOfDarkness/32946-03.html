That's... That's Spezion's corpse... the traitor who rose up against God! Shhhh! Don't say that so loud! What? Oh, the shaking? Yeah, the entire town is shaking. There's this huge pendulum called the <font color="LEVEL">Spiral of Guard</font> that's making everything shake. It's supposed to restrain Spezion! But now it's just shaking cats all over the place! <br>
Slaski ordered me to find out why... so I came here to check it out. I, umm, figured out what's going on, but I have no idea what to do about it. Wanna help me decide?
