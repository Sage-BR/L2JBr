Well done. The Embryo will take a while to recover from this.<br>So, you were looking for Ertheia? I remembered right after you left that they came by in a cluster. Making a racket too, about having found something near this place.<br>
I don't know what they found, though. A Human came by and took something from that very spot, merely moments before you got here. I guess you're too late.
