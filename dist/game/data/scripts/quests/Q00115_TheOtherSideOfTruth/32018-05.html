Hey! You'll join! Let me start by wishing you good luck... I always start with that.<br>
Now to get you up to speed. Guild informants have disappeared, one by one, while gathering information on the Queen...<br>
We just learned why.<br>Or at least what. The Ice Queen transformed them... into ice. I just KNOW they were hot on the trail of something important! Can you pick up where the trail leaves off? Our associates were found in their cursed state on <font color="LEVEL">the plain above the North corner from the Ice Queen's castle entrance</font>. You'll have to be careful.
