<html><body>High Priestess Levian:<br>
Near Windy Hill, there are Orc Barracks. It's where the Turek Orcs have settled.<br>
But the Orcs have been behaving strangely lately.<br>
I'm worried if they intend to invade this village using the odd happenings on Windy Hill. If that happens, it will be catastrophic.<br>
First go to the <font color="LEVEL">Orc Barracks</font> and talk to <font color="LEVEL">Piotur</font>. He will tell you what you need to know.
