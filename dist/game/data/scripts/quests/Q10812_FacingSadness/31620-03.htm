What do you think of the monsters of the Material Realm? Those monsters are the subject to our blades, due to our long history in battle.<br>
I know of some creatures who were turned into monsters as a result of experiments. And there are those who've lost their precious ones to those monsters. I know their sadness and anger. But we don't always remember them when we defeat those monsters.<br>
I believe we must always remember the sadness and anger that they hold within. Don't you agree?<br>
