I'm about to give you a very long test. In that process, I want you to remember the sadness and anger of many.<br>
Go defeat the monsters in <font color="LEVEL">Raider's Crossroads</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Hellbound</font> and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Proof of Disposal</font>.<br1>
If you <font color="LEVEL">defeat the stronger monsters in Hellbound</font>, you'll be able to collect the <font color="LEVEL">Proof of Disposal</font> even faster.<br>
In that long process, never forget the sadness that derives from long battles against the monsters.
