<html><body>Olympiad Manager:<br>
I've been constantly meeting Noblesse. So there's no one else who can recognize a Noblesse.<br>
Recently, I've discussed with the Mysterious Butler about ways to find true heroes. Up until then, I've tested people by asking them to participate in the Olympiad.<br>
However, I've concluded that in order to find a true hero, I should test them both by making them show me proof that they've participated in the <font color="LEVEL">Olympiad</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Ceremony of Chaos</font>.<br>
