<html><body>Head Priest of the Earth Daichir:<br>
Defeat the monsters that are threatening the safety of this world. I'll tell you which ones to defeat.<br>
First, you must defeat <font color="LEVEL">Istina, Octavis, and Tauti</font> in an <font color="LEVEL">Epic Battle</font>. You must also defeat <font color="LEVEL">Beleth</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Earth Wyrm Trasken</font>, and bring a <font color="LEVEL">Dark Soul Stone</font>.<br>
However, defeating Earth Wyrm Trasken is difficult. That's why I have another method. Would like to hear it?<br>
