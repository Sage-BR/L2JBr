<html><body>Head Priest of the Earth Daichir:<br>
If you want to achieve true strength, defeat the monsters who threaten the safety of this world. I'll tell you which monsters to defeat.<br>
You must defeat <font color="LEVEL">Istina, Octavis, and Tauti</font> in an <font color="LEVEL">Epic Battle</font>. You must also defeat <font color="LEVEL">Beleth and Earth Wyrm Trasken</font>.<br>
However, defeating Earth Wyrm Trasken is difficult. That's why I have another method. Would like to hear it?<br>
