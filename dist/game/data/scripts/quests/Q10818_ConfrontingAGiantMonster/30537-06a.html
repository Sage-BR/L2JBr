Strong monsters have been appearing near the Crystal Caverns. You can get <font color="LEVEL">Veridan's Soul Stone</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Kechi's Soul Stone</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Michaela's Soul Stone</font> when you defeat <font color="LEVEL">Armed Veridan, Armed Kechi, and Armed Michaela</font> respectively. When you combine these three, you can get a <font color="LEVEL">Dark Soul Stone</font>.<br>
This is the same item that you can get after defeating Earth Wyrm Trasken. So if you can get a Dark Soul Stone this way, I'll consider it as if you've defeated Earth Wyrm Trasken.
