Ah, I see. I am a rune scholar who helps out the Giant's Minions. From what they sent over, I've found something called <font color="LEVEL">Inverted Ewaz</font>, an ancient text which can harness the power of Giants.<br>
I'm not sure, but I suspect this was some kind of spell to suppress the Giants' powers. I'd like to find out more...will you help me?<br>
