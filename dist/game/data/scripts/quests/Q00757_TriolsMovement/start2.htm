And if you get the chance, can you bring back <font color="LEVEL">Pagan Souls</font> as well? can get them from all pagans here, just like the totems.<br>
It won't be as easy because you can't get them if the pagans' souls had been taken by the devil. But when you spend enough time <font color="LEVEL">collecting all the Pagan Totems</font>, collecting the Pagan Souls will come naturally. Just bring them to me and I'll give you a special little something.<br>
Did you get everything I said?<br>
