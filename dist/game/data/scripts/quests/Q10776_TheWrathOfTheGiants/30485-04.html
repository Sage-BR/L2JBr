I see you haven't left yet. Don't worry yourself.<br>
I don't know how easy it'll be communicating with an Ancient Giant, but he won't refuse a request from a beautiful race like the Ertheia.<br>
Find the <font color="LEVEL">Broken Device</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Tower</font> and <font color="LEVEL">insert</font> the <font color="LEVEL">Regeneration Device Core</font>.<br>
The magic from the Regeneration Device Core will enable the device to work temporarily. Once it's up and running, you'll be able to find the Ancient Giant sleeping inside Cruma Tower. Good luck.
