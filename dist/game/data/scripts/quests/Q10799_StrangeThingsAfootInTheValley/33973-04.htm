The southern region is generally more dangerous than the north.<br>
So for now, I want to send you to the less dangerous region to reduce the number of dragons and Undead there. On the north side of Dragon Valley, you'll find <font color="LEVEL">Mesmer Dragon, Gargoyle Dragon, Black Dragon, Emerald Dragon, Sand Dragon, Dragonblood Captain, Dragonblood Minion, Cave Servant Archer, Cave Servant Warrior, Metal Cave Servant, Iron Cave Servant, and Headless Knight</font>. You need to slay <font color="LEVEL">100</font> of them.<br>Until we can figure out where they're coming from and how to fix the situation, we're just going to have to try and remove the danger some other way.
