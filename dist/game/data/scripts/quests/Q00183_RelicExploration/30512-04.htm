<html><body>Head Blacksmith Kusto:<br>
Lorain is stationed just outside the entrance to Cruma Tower studying the technology of the ancient Giants. I believe, however, that the monsters who inhabit the Tower are threatening her safety...and interrupting her research. Would you help her? Please, I beg of you...<br>
(Please note that you cannot enter Cruma Tower if you are over level 52)
