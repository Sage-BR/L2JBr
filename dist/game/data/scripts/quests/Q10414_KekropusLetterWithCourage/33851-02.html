Uh, Argos is a Giant with 100 eyes...<br>
Well, anyway. The problem is that the <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> has been trying to use the <font color="LEVEL">Eye of Argos</font> for their needs. So far the effort has been fruitless, but we have no time to waste. Help me win the <font color="LEVEL">Eye of Argos'</font> favor.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">- Note: You can hunt and do quests at Wall of Argos. You may receive Kekropus' Letter for the next stage at Level 76.</font>
