Good! <font color="LEVEL">For every 100 Infernium Ores you recover, I will give you a chance to play bingo.</font> If you do well in bingo you will also receive a nice reward: a necessary ingredient for the manufacture of an A-Grade weapon. Nice, eh?<br>
Oh! I forgot to tell you something important. From the footprints, fur and eyewitness testimony, the monsters that attacked the blacksmith shop seem to be <font color="LEVEL"> Crimson drakes, kadios, Fallen Orc Shamans, Sharp Talon Tigers, Giant's shadows, Creatures of the Past and Soldiers of Ancient Times</font>. Please help us -- our Guild's pride is at stake!
