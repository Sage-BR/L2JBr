Something happened a few days ago. The <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith who was refining Infernium was attacked by monsters</font>, and all the Infernium ore were stolen. That ore was going to be used to construct a new, state-of-the-art warehouse. We must retrieve them at all costs! <br>
Will you help us <font color="LEVEL">retrieve the Infernium ore</font>? We will gladly pay you...<br>
