I'll place numbers 1-9 on a 3x3 number pad. Then you need to pick 6 numbers out of 1-9. When you have finished making your choices, we count how many horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines were created by your choice of numbers. Is that clear enough? I think you'll understand once you play. <br>
If your numbers make 3 lines, I'll give you a reward.<br>
