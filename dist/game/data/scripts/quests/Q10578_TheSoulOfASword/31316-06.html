Well, it's better to just try it for yourself. Here's a <font color="LEVEL">Practice StormBringer</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">Practice Soul Crystal-Stage 1</font>. You'll need to have a Gemstone that is appropriate for the level of the Soul Crystal. Now, I'll give you a <font color="LEVEL"></font>Practice Soul Crystal Gemstone, but next time, you'll have to obtain the Gemstone yourself.<br>
You can purchase Gemstones from the <font color="LEVEL">Traders</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Store</font> in the Village. There are various Stores in the village and each trader sells different items. It'll be good to know about their items.<br>
If you want to try a Soul Crystal ability with other weapons, you can always try it out.<br>
