Let me offer a proposal. I'm confident that this will be very useful to you. I'll give you the items needed for experiencing Soul Crystals and I'll also teach you how. You just need to do as I tell you and try Soul Crystal. If you succeed in this, I'll give you a little reward.<br>
So, what do you think? Isn't it a nice opportunity?<br>
