<html><body>Mysterious Wizard:<br>
I need <font color="LEVEL">Monster Blood</font> as well. With a bit more effort, you should be able to extract it from the same <font color="LEVEL">Undead</font>.<br>
Once you've killed a few, and <font color="LEVEL">collected all the Monster Bones</font> I need, you'll know how to get the blood. Bring enough, and I will give you an additional reward.<br>
Understand?<br>
