The late king Travis and his soldiers were heroes of our past. Please let them remain that way. Grant them peace.  <br>
I will reward you the best I can if you bring me <font color="LEVEL">50</font> <font color="LEVEL">Marks of Travis</font>. And if you bring me some <font color="LEVEL">Returner's Souls</font> too, I will be sure to reward you as much as you deserve.
