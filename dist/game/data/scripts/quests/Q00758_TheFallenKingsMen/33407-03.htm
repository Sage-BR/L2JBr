Get me some <font color="LEVEL">Returner's Souls</font> too. As with the Marks of Travis, you'll probably find them on the ghost soldiers.<br>
That is, if the souls haven't been devoured by darkness already. But spend enough time<font color="LEVEL">collecting all the Marks of Travis</font>, and getting those souls will come naturally. Bring them to me, and I'll reward you handsomely.<br>
Do I need to repeat anything?
