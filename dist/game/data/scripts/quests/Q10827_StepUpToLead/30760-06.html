If you are strong, you must have the courage to step up and lead others! I believe you have what it takes to grow into that role. Am I not right?<br>
Show me your ability to gather people and defeat monsters even in dangerous times such as these. If you can show me that, I'll give you a certificate.<br>
Lead others, and receive the <font color="LEVEL">Party Leader Bonus</font> at least <font color="LEVEL">30 times</font>. That will show me your courage and abilities.
