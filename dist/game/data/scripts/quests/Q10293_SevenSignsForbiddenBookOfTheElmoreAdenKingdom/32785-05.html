<html><body>Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:<br>
Is that so? That book... Hm... Hardin mentioned something about this. There was a saintess called Solina, she appeared during the end of the Elmoreden Kingdom. I vaguely recall some connection between Solina and Embryo. If so, they would have to have something in common between them.<br>
Let's go see the Library Director and ask about this Saintess Solina.
