<html><body>Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:<br>
Monastery of Silence was where Saintess Solina and her pupils were staying. The Monastery's true history is known only to a few... Anyway, according to this book, we can learn more about Solina and her pupils from inside the Monastery.<br>
I will make plans to sneak inside the Monastery. Let's meet here again later. And good work, my friend.
