<html><body>Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:<br>
Is that so? That book... Hm... I've heard about this from Hardin. He said a saintess called Solina appeared in the final era of the Elmoreden Kingdom. I think Solina might be related to Embryo. If that's true, there would be something in common between Embryo and Solina. Let's go to see the Library Director and ask about Saintess Solina together.
