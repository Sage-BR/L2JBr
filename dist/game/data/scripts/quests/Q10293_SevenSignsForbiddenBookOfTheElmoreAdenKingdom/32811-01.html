In the beginning of time, there was a sphere that held the contents of our great universe. Within that sphere were two great powers, one light, and one dark. These powers absorbed matter more basic and more complex than our minds can comprehend. They aligned with matter and sounds and forms and ideas, and then formed shapes.
