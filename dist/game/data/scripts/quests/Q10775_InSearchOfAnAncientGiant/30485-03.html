A broken device? Are you thinking about meeting the Ancient Giant?<br>
The giant is the most elusive creature of them all. It's highly more likely you will not get the information you desire from him. And he's much more dangerous than you think. But you're still determined?<br>
Ha...Whatever it is, I see that it's pertinent that you find the Ancient Giant. I don't know what your intentions are, but please be warned that the Ancient Giant will not speak the truth.<br>
Have you brought the Energy of Regeneration? Give it to me, and I'll repair the device for you.<br><br>
