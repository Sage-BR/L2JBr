It won't be possible to perfectly restore the device. But, using the Energy of Regeneration, I can make a Regeneration Device Core, which will allow the device to function for a short while.<br>
Even with the Regeneration Device Core, you won't be able to use the device for long. You'll only be able to have a short conversation.<br>
Anyway, since you need to find the Ancient Giant, I will make the Regeneration Device Core. It's going to take awhile, so please wait.
