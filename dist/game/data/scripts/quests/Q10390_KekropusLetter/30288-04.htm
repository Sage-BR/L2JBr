Good. You've learned that much at least.<br>
Go to <font color="LEVEL">Captain Bathis</font> in the Town of Gludio. He'll have a letter for you with instructions about the mission.<br>
This is likely the last time we'll speak. You'll move on through the world, gaining power and responsibility while I stay behind to mentor the next heroes. Be safe, child. May the Power of Light always be with you!<br>
