The advent of Shilen put all lives at the verge of extinction. The leaders of each race promised to put their past conflicts and feuds aside and to cooperate with one another. They also agreed to tighten security to prevent possible threats to any race.<br>

You've always done a good job for us. I think you are the right person for this task.<br>
