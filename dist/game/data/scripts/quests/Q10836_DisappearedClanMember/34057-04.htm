I heard a rumor that the Blackbird clan members were spotted inside the fortress. It looks like the Aden Vanguard went inside to secure the strongholds, so please go ask Adolph.<br>
If you find the clan members, please bring them back. If it's difficult for them to escape, please at least bring some proof that they are safe.<br>
Just in case the clan members get suspicious of you, I'll lend you a seal that is only given to Blackbird clan members. I'm counting on you.
