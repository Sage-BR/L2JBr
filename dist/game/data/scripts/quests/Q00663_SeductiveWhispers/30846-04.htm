When a being's thought or spirit energy comes together into the shape of a bead, we call that a Spirit Bead. Artisans like me need them to make good weapons. That's why we gamble with them -- as they're worth a lot to us. In this area, they say that you can easily get Spirit Beads if uou fo to the <font color="LEVEL">Ancient Battleground and the Field of Massacre</font>.<br>
At <font color="LEVEL">the Ancient Battleground</font>, you can obtain <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> from the undead known as <font color="LEVEL">Knights of the Past, Ghostly Warriors, Starving Corpses, Dark Guards, Death Agents and Nihil Invaders</font> and from the demons known as <font color="LEVEL">Bloody Loards, Bloody Priests, Bloody Knights and Bloody Ghosts</font>.<br>
At the <font color="LEVEL">Field of Massacre</font>, you can obtain <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Beads</font> from the undead known as <font color="LEVEL">Doom Scouts, Doom Servants, Doom Guards, Doom Archers, Doom Troopers, Doom Warriors, Doom Knights, Archers of Destruction, Spiteful Soul Leaders, Spiteful Soul Wizards and Spiteful Soul Fighters</font>.<br>
I think that's enough information for you to get started. Is there anything else you'd like to know?<br>
