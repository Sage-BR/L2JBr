Near Gludin Village, there's a place called Windy Hill where Wind Spirits dwell. But due to the sealing of Beleth, they have become violent.<br>
Then recently, outside wind energy was observed -- there are now spirits that were never seen in the Material Realm before.<br>
I need you to go investigate if possible. I don't want any harm done to Gludin Village.<br>
First go to <font color="LEVEL">Windy Hill</font> and see <font color="LEVEL">Researcher Pio</font> for the details.
