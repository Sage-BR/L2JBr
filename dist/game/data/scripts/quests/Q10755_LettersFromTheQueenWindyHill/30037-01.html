Welcome. I was waiting after receiving Queen Navari's message.<br>
Gludin Village is not as busy as it used to be. When Ertheia delegation visited, I was really shocked. I still can't forget the day I saw that legendary race for the first time.<br>
The delegation only came here because they were lost. But what brings you here?<br>
