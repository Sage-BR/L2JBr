Ahh, the support soldier from the village, yes? Welcome. And you are just in time. Perhaps you saw Sakum on your way here? It just passed by. I was... I couldn't help but look, but I didn't dare approach. If you saw it, you'd know what I meant... it just freezes you in your tracks.<br>
Anyway, I intend to draw a sketch of Sakum before I forget what it looked like, in hopes that it'll help someone else track it down. Meanwhile, I hope you can defeat some of the other monsters that have been stirred up by Sakum.<br>
