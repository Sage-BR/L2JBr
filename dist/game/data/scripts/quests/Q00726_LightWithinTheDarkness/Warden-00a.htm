<html><body>Camp Keeper:<br>
It's an odd time to be alive, I tell you. Strange happenings and omens. Frightening portents of danger and doom. I'm not sure what to make of them, but I do know that we need more power! Yes, we need to focus on increasing our strengths before it's too late.<br>
You, focus. Work hard to become stronger and more powerful. The more powerful you become, the better able you'll be to protect yourself and your clan!<br>
(This quest is for characters level 85 or above.)
