It's not difficult. You will have to do it if you're looking for the delegation anyway. When you're hunting the monsters on Forsaken Plains, you will come across <font color="LEVEL">Embryo Predators</font>. Get those <font color="LEVEL">Embryo Predators</font> and collect <font color="LEVEL">50 Missive Scraps</font>. I'm trying to find out what Embryo is planning.<br>
It's likely that the Ertheia delegation was attacked by an Embryo Predator. It's going to help your investigation anyway. I will try to find out about the delegation as well.
