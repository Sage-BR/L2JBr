Alright, once you infiltrate the Atelia Castle, you'll be able to meet <font color="LEVEL">Kelbim</font>.<br>
Once you defeat him, you'll be able to get <font color="LEVEL">Kelbim's Armor Piece</font>. There's someone who needs that item, so go find her.<br>
Her name is in <font color="LEVEL">Kaysia</font>, and she's in the <font color="LEVEL">forge in the Town of Oren</font>. She was eyeing Kelbim's Armor Piece, so take it to her once you have it.
