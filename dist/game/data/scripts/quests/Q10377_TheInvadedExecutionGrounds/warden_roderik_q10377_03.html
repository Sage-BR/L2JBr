<html><body>Guillotine Fortress Watchman Roderik:<br>
After <font color="LEVEL">Guillotine of Death</font> turned this place into his fortress, everything changed. Even the land changed, and we can't spare scouts. It's impossible to plan without knowing the land. Could you scout for us?<br>
I've heard that the <font color="LEVEL">Tombstones</font> are particularly haunted, so check the <font color="LEVEL">Tombstone of Houpon the Warden Overseer, Tombstone of Crook the Mad, and Tombstone of the Guillotine of Death</font>.<br>
When you have finished, report to <font color="LEVEL">Guillotine Fortress Watchman Endrigo</font> over there, and give him this report as well.<br>
