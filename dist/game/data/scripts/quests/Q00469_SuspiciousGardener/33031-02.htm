In ancient times, the gods instructed Defenders protect the Forerunners. Now, when the ancient gods have sunk into oblivion, Defenders, drawn by the desire for power, intend to use the power of the Forerunners to their advantage. I've heard rumors that some of the precursors appear in the Ancient City Arkan and in the land of Aden, where they sowed chaos and destruction. Nobody knows what will happen even if you do not stop the Defenders.<br>
Our nation is trying to prevent their evil plans. But we need help. I ask, assist - Destroy 30 Defenders.<br>
