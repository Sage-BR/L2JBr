<font color="LEVEL">%playername%</font>. I've been waiting for you.<br>
Since the last time you came to see me, I've thought about it a lot. It's hard to imagine you came all way to this dangerous place just because you were curious. But I highly respect that you are capable enough to come to me safely after fighting all the Golems and Spiculas infected with the Laido Virus.<br>
I may not be able to sate your curiosity, but let me make a proposal. I intend to pay up on my end, of course - this could be a little dangerous or very dangerous, depending on how you look at it.<br>
