I've been waiting for you! So you met <font color="LEVEL">Verna</font>, huh? She said someone called <font color="LEVEL">WinningSheen</font> came to ask her all kinds of questions about Mother Nornil, and wanted to talk to you again. You must have really impressed her, huh? She remembers your name!<br>
So why don't you go see her if you're not busy? Since she's looking for you and all.<br>
