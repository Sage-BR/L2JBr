It's <font color="LEVEL">Spicula Zero</font>, awakened by Morther Nornil to fight Dr. Chaos.<br>
To go to Nornil's Garden, find the <font color="LEVEL">Boz Core</font> in the darkest depths of <font color="LEVEL">Nornil's Cave</font>.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Nornil Teleport Device</font> is still at the cave entrance. Dr. Chaos can't be forgiven for what he has done to Isle of Souls, but at least he left something handy behind.<br>
Battling Spicula Zero will be dangerous. You must bring companions with you.
