Still as curious as ever, I see. This entity is a soulless weapon driven only to destroy. It bears no resemblance to the Metusela Kamaels, who walk their paths with their own strength of will.<br>
You can meet this entity at <font color="LEVEL">Nornil's Garden</font>. It has remained within, which means its powers have not yet fully awakened. I fear to imagine what could happen to Isle of Souls when it leaves Nornil's Garden.<br>
I will tell you its identity if you go to fight it.<br>
