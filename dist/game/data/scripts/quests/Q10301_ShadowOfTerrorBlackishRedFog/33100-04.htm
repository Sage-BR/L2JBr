Thank you! Thank you!<br1>
Please, you must go to the cave entrance behind <font color="LEVEL">Anghel Waterfall</font> and find the <font color="LEVEL">Wisp's Favorite Large Verdant Wilds</font> . Use the <font color="LEVEL">Glimmer Crystal</font> that I just gave you, and <font color="LEVEL">Wisps</font> will swarm in. Take THEM to Slaski in the Ancient City of Arcan, and he'll be much more likely to talk to you.<br>
Cats are cautious by nature, so you won't get anything if you go in empty handed.
