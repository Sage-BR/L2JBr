We don't know what Blackish Red Fog is, nor how it was created. There is one thing though...<br>
Did you happen to hear about Magmeld? According to Slaski, strange things are going on near the Ancient City of Arcan, and started around the time the horrific disease appeared. They say the Trees of Genesis and Fairies that live near Ancient City became enraged and crazy.<br>
Strange, no? They'd lived peacefully for so long, and then to suddenly change just as events are unfolding elsewhere?<br>
