<html><body>Tracker Hatuba:<br>
If <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> is behind the <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious Vagabond</font>. If both of them work for <font color="LEVEL">Shilen</font>. Is this too much for me to handle alone? No! I must tell the other Orc Trackers right away. <br>
But I can't just leave the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of the Dead</font>. My comrades lost their lives here. Their blood ties me to this ground.<br>
