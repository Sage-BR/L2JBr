Why haven't you gotten the Embryo, Forest of the Dead Scouts yet?<br>
Look. Just go after a few undead monsters here in the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of the Dead</font>. Then, the <font color="LEVEL">Embryo, the Forest of the Dead Scouts,</font> will appear. Defeat <font color="LEVEL">50</font> of them. Not hard, right?
