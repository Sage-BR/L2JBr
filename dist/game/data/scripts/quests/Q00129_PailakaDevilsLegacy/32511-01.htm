Thanks! Is it my imagination, or did your body just become a bit blurry?<br>
You don't look like you're from around here... Am I right? You appeared just as suddenly as those pirates!<br>
Anyway, thank you. Please take these gifts.<br>
Among them is a magic item capable of returning you to your world. Use the Scroll of Escape to leave Pailaka and return to where you belong!<br>
