Now, you must know about the Seal of Shilen outside Aden Castle. The whole area is filled with evil energy as the Goddess of Death, Shilen, gathers her energies. Creatures have emerged, and are looking to assault Aden Castle itself!<br>
We sought to defeat their forces, and sent a contingent to the enemy stronghold, but we haven't heard from them in quite some time now. I would like you to find them, help them, and report their status back to me.<br>
