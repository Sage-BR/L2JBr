Captain Adolph's team is in the underground crypt near the Cemetery, fighting monsters that resurrected through Shilen. Go and help him if you can. Powerful creatures are blocking the entrance to the crypt, so you'd better teleport through the Aden Vanguard Member standing behind me.<br>
Good luck, warrior of Aden.
