<html><body>Eva's Knight Lionel Hunter:<br>
The power given to us by the gods... we called it Noblesse. But you've proven that we are now able to overcome any limits without the protection of the gods.<br>
Now that you've shattered the limits set by the gods, we will call you <font color="LEVEL">Exalted</font>. You are now one step above Noblesse. Congratulations.
