You haven't finished all the tests. In order to overcome your limit, you must pass all the tests.<br>
You must overcome not just the limit of the power you were born with, but also the limit of the new power you obtained.<br>
Make sure your <font color="LEVEL">Dual Class</font> also reaches <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 100</font>. Then, go find <font color="LEVEL">Merlot</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Hunter's Village</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Captain Kurtiz</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Aden</font>, the <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Sir Gustav Athebaldt</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Oren</font>, and pass the tests they give you.<br>
It's best that you hear about the tests from them. Remember to bring back their certificates.
