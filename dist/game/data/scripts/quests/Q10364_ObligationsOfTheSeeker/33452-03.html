That's the problem, I don't know what happened! We've been working together just fine,  then suddenly he gets all bent out of shape and storms off. I tried to find out what the problem was, and smooth things over, but he wouldn't even talk to me.<br>
I don't know what he's all worked up about, and frankly, I don't care! Stubborn old... Grr!<br>
Well, I have some work related papers that I want to give to him, but I don't want to make waves. Could you take them to him for me?<br>
