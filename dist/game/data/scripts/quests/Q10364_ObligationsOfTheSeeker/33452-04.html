Ah, it's not so difficult. Old <font color="LEVEL">pieces of paper</font> have been appearing around here. I'm not sure what they're regarding, but Dep likes this kind of stuff.<br1>
I want you to gather 5 or so, then hand them to <font color="LEVEL">Dep</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Exploration Area 4</font>.<br>
You'll find the pieces of paper by defeating the <font color="LEVEL">Husk Kraphers and Husk Avians</font>.<br>
And... say hi to him for me, okay?
