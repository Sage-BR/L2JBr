Walter? Hm...<br>
Actually, I've known about the paper pieces in Ye Sagira for quite some time now...<br>
I just wasn't sure exactly where they were. I was looking for them a while back, wandering through Exploration Zone 3 with Walter, but he kept following me and talking to me and... well... I ended up losing my temper and shouting at him... we haven't spoken since.<br>
Did he say anything else?<br>
