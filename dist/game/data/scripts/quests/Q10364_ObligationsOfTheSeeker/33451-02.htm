Well... good!<br>
So you must see how jarring it is when two commandos in the same unit don't see eye to eye! Sadly, I'm not just spouting hypotheticals here - there are two soldiers in my unit who won't talk to each other. If they were to go into combat, they'd be one hell of a weak link...<br>
I want someone to get them talking again. Negotiate, bang their heads together... I don't care.<br>
