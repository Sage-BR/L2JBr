<html><body>Mysterious Wizard:<br>
Me? Perhaps it was some other wizard passing by? There are many wizards in the world.<br>
By the way, I took the liberty of burying the dead body of the Ertheia, so please do not be angry.<br>
I will give you this to earn your trust. An item <font color="LEVEL">belonging to the dead</font>. Its as if it is from another world.<br>
I like you very much. I hope to see you again.
