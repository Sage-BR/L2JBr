<html><body>Queen Navari:<br>
You've hit the limit of the 1st Liberation. Congratulations.<br1>
Why congratulate? I'm glad that you have gotten far enough to require <font color="LEVEL">Liberation</font>.<br>
You've recovered some of the <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Abilities</font>, which you lost while coming here. But you can't get any further on your own. Unless you're satisfied where you are, you need help from someone who's at the top of your profession.<br>
Do you want to receive help?<br>
