<html><body>Master Katalin:<br>
I'm thankful that he got Telesha's body. But are you sure he had nothing to do with her death? Also, it's strange that her body disappeared into wind like that.<br>
I must report her death to the Queen. All of Faeron will grieve.<br>
Oh no. I was so sad about her death that I forgot. There was a reason I sent you there. Did you find the object of the Wind Spirit Realm?<br>
