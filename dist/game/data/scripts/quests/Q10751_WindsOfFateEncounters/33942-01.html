I've been waiting for you. The Queen told me about an Ertheia who would come to <font color="LEVEL">Liberate</font> their <font color="LEVEL">abilities</font>. She's been quite interested in you -- perhaps because you have talent? The Queen is a gifted wizard for a Nann, you know.<br>
Anyway, you must know that the Ertheia are being targeted by many on the continent for powers unknown to this world. For this reason, I can only help those strong enough to be a part of the <font color="LEVEL">delegation</font> Liberate -- or else we will have a weakling falling into the wrong hands, and all of our secrets being found out! Are you willing?<br>
