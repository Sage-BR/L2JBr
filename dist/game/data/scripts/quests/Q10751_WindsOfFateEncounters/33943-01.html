You must be the one Queen Navari has told me about. She said an Ertheia was on the way here for her Liberation. Perhaps she saw something special in you? For a Nann, Queen Navari wields great magic. I'm sure there is a reason she kept an eye on you.<br>
But the power of Ertheia is new to the Material Realm, and many covet it. For this reason, we're only helping those good enough to work as a part of the <font color="LEVEL">delegation</font> with their Liberation. So, are you ready?<br>
