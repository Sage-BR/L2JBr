Thank you! I know we were enemies once, but...<br>
My kin have turned into monsters who crave killing and blood. I could not watch them any longer, so I started a Warming Fire in the Outlaw Forest...but couldn't stay in that hellish place long enough to pay my respects.<br>
So please go to the <font color="LEVEL">Outlaw Forest</font> and convey <font color="LEVEL">my condolences</font> to my kin on a <font color="LEVEL">Warming Fire</font> on my behalf!
