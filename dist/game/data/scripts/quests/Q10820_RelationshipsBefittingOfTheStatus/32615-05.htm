Well, here's an easier explanation. In order to craft a Citrine Pendant, you need two things.<br>
First, you must be an <font color="LEVEL">experienced Maestro</font>. If you are not a top-class artisan, you won't be able to even try crafting this item. It looks like you meet this condition.<br>
The second is <font color="LEVEL">luck</font>. Without luck, it won't matter how great of a Maestro you are.<br>
I believe that in order to become strong, you must have someone who can maintain your equipment, and the better luck you have, the bigger the chances that you'll get stronger.<br>
