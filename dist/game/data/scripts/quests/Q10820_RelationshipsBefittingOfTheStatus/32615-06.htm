Well, here's an easier explanation. In order to craft a Citrine Pendant, you need two things.<br>
First, you need an <font color="LEVEL">experienced Maestro</font>. One must be a top-class artisan to even try crafting this item. It's great if you have someone who can maintain your equipment for you, but if you don't, you must maintain a good relationship with an experienced Maestro at all times.<br>
The second is <font color="LEVEL">luck</font>. Without luck, it won't matter how great of a Maestro one is.<br>
I believe that in order to become strong, you must have someone who can maintain your equipment, and the better luck you have, the bigger the chances that you'll get stronger.<br>
