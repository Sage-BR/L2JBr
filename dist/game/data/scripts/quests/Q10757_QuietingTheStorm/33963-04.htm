Oh it's about the Windy Hill. It's where winds in different directions meet and make a vortex. However, we couldn't see the vortex with our eyes in the past.<br>
But recently, perhaps due to the energy from the Wind Realm, the vortex has gotten so big that it's visible. Leaving the vortex will eventually harm the towns nearby.<br>
We can't do nothing knowing that it's going to do harm. Speaking of which, can you do me a favor?<br>
