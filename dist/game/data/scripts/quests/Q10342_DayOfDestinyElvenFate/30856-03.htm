You're probably aware of the Seal of Shilen region located in the outskirts of Aden Castle. However, you might not be aware that Shilen's minions are now preparing to attack this Aden Castle.<br>
We found where the minions were gathering, and, hoping to catch them unawares, sent a party to attack them before they had left. As you probably guessed... we haven't heard anything from them. We need someone... you... to find them.<br>
