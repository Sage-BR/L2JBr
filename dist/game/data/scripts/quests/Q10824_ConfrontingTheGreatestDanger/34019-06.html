I would like you to go into the other dimension and participate in the <font color="LEVEL">Dimensional Raid</font> to defeat those monsters. I'm sure someone who can protect the world like that will go on to do greater things and acquire greater powers.<br>
When you defeat monsters in the other dimension, you'll get a <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Advance</font>. Get <font color="LEVEL">3</font> of these and bring them back to me. You need to keep in mind that each time you participate in the <font color="LEVEL">Dimensional Raid</font> you will only get <font color="LEVEL">1 Mark of Advance</font>. <br> <br> <br>
Also, remember that I can only open the gate on certain days. I can send you there on <font color="LEVEL">Saturdays when there are no Dimensional Castle Sieges, between 19:00~22:00</font>. Just come find me during those times.
