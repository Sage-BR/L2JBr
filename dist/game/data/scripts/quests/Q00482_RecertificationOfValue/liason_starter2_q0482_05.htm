Didn't we already have this discussion? Like a million times already? Or was that someone else… never mind, I guess I can tell you again.<br>
Our Krasis is basically a group of Dark Elves who specialize in making problems... disappear. We mostly hire out to the notabilities, and work behind the scenes. We've been around since the moon was young. Why we've been the silent power behind many of the most dramatic events in history.<br>
We've always guarded the knowledge of our existence very carefully, but with the current crisis with Shilen, we've decided that we need to step into the light and take a more prominent role.<br>
