If you help Krasis, I will also help you all I can. I can tell you now that you will benefit just as much, if not more.<br>
I can give you buffs and, if necessary, even teleport you to the front of the Tower of Insolence where you are to carry out the mission. Feel free to tell me whatever you wish to say.<br>
