If we want to win in this war against Shilen, we need to slap the power from her hands to give us an extra edge. She's the one who's behind the recent plethora of disasters and in order to fight her we need someone to get their hands a little dirty to win. We have an operative located at the <font color="LEVEL">Tower of Insolence</font> ready to brief you if you want to take the gig. We're running low on resources so we can't send her in to handle the task if that was what you were thinking.<br>
Krasis has given the okay to allow contract adventures to assist us in our missions. Unfortunately, there is no financial compensation, but you'll get experience performing these types of missions and earn all types of credit with the Krasis.<br>
