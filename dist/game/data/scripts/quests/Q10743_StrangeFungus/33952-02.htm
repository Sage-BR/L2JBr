Growlers are mushroom spirits. They used to be cute and calm spirits, but once they entered the Material Realm, they became dangerous. They were never known to harm anyone back in the Wind Spirit Realm.<br>
Oh, my, I'm rambling again. So, about these <font color="LEVEL">unusual mushroom spirits</font>.<br>
All the Growlers living in their habitat are the same color. But recently, I was out searching for Ricky when I came across a Growler that was a different color from the rest.<br>
What if that particular Growler is poisonous? Ricky could get hurt! Please go see if that Growler is poisonous!<br>
