All right. That unusual mushroom won't be easy to spot. It appears when the normal Growlers disappear, or something. Hard to explain.<br>
Anyway, if you cut down the Growlers, <font color="LEVEL">Evolved Growlers</font> will appear in their place. Collect some Growler spores and take them to <font color="LEVEL">Forest Patrol Milone</font>. Milone is an expert at mushrooms!
