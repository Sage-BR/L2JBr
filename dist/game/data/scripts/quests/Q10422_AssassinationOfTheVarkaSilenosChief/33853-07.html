Thank you for your hard work. Our greatest headache is gone! <br>. 
Of course, we'll keep close eyes on <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>. They'll be back for sure with a new plot, I'm sure. <br>
I'll be sure to let <font color="LEVEL">Kekropus</font> know of your role in these dealings. You will always be honored among us!
