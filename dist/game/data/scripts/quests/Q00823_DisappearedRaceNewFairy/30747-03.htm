We know of a way to defeat those spirits, at least temporarily. This way, we'll be able to put the spirits at rest, even if it's just for a little while.<br>
Of course, we will give you a reward for your help. And there is one more thing. While you are helping us, you'll build trust with us. The more we trust you, the more rewards we will give you, and there are some secret missions that we only give to those we trust.<br>
That's about it.<br>
