<html><body>Enron:<br>
Do you know anything about alligators? Long ago, alligators came from Avella of the Orient and settled on <font color="LEVEL">Alligator Island</font>. Nowadays, it's just covered in those cursed water lizards! That's why it's called <font color="LEVEL">Alligator Island</font>.<br>
The alligators are so violent! The people at the castle can't do anything about them, and no one just enjoys the island. I'd stay away from there unless you have a death wish...<br>
