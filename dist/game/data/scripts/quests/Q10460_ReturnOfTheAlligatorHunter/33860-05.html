I thought you were supposed to be some great hunter or something. I'm not a charity here, you know?<br>
Catch any <font color="LEVEL">Alligator, Crokian Lad, Dailaon Lad, Crokian Lad Warrior, Parhit Lad, or Nos Lad</font> you see on <font color="LEVEL">Alligator Island</font>, and bring their <font color="LEVEL">skin</font>. You'll be compensated based on skin quality. Now go make me some change!
