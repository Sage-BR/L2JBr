Do you know anything about alligators? Since long before, an influx of alligators came from Avellan in the east and settled on <font color="LEVEL">Alligator Island</font>, began propagating, and covered the island with alligators. The name of the island was even changed to <font color="LEVEL">Alligator Island</font>.<br>
These alligators are so ferocious, even those from the castle couldn't approach them. So don't risk your life going after them.<br>
(Ertheia classes cannot perform this quest.)
