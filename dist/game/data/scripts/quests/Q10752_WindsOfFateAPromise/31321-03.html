<html><body>Grand Master Siegmund:<br>
I'm sorry, but if you've come hoping to find a savior, you've wasted a trip. He is not here. He's difficult to find, period. We can't even know where he might be.<br>
I heard he's wandering far and wide searching for something, but I didn't think he'd go that far. If you want to find him, how about talking to the chief of the <font color="LEVEL">blacksmiths</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Head Blacksmith Lombert</font>? He likes to brag about how he's always served Kain Van Halter since Kain's childhood. I don't know if that's true, but he claims to have made a sword for Kain.
