You are an Ertheia? From the Wind Spirit Realm? I heard that there's a small forest near Faeron. Dwarf Dolkin is my friend, and he's been working on making armor out of leaves from that place. He's always telling me about how beautiful that place is. Still, unless there's some type of amazing steel over there, I'm happy here.<br>
So, what brings you here? Do you need weapons?<br>
