Who would have thought that the reputable Von Hellmann family would raise a rebellion? That place became a land of death when the king's royal guards battled against them. No one knows how it happened, but the Hellmanns became vampires. There are rumors about a black wizard having something to do with it, but no one knows what exactly happened.<br>
Anyway, ever since then, Master Kain has been going around looking for a way to turn Giselle back to normal. It looks like he still goes there from time to time to see how Giselle is doing.<br>
