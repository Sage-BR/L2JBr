Master Kain's half-sister is Giselle Van Halter. Since Master Kain didn't wholly inherit the royal blood, Giselle would be his half-sister. Well, she's <font color="LEVEL">Giselle Von Hellmann</font> now that she got married. Such a pity. I still can't believe that beautiful Giselle became a <font color="LEVEL">vampire</font>. When Master Kain came back after being gone for a while...you can imagine his grief.  He really cared about his little sister.<br>
