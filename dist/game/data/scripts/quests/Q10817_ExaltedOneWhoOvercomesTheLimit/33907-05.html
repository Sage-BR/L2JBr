I'll tell you about the second test.<br>
First, you must reach <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 100</font>. You must truly overcome the limit that was set in the past. You must also pass the tests from the following people and receive their certificates.<br>
The ones who will be testing you are <font color="LEVEL">Head Priest of the Earth Daichir</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Schuttgart</font>, the <font color="LEVEL">Olympiad Manager</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Maestro Ishuma</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Wharf of Gludio Airships</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Sir Kristof Rodemai</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Giran</font>. <br><br><br>Only they know what they'll test you on, so go talk to them.<br>
If you forget who you must go to, refer to the guide I'll be giving you.
