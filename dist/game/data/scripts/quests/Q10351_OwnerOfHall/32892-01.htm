If you're ready, I'll tell you.... I'll tell you the story that has been passed down in this place, Magmeld. Originally this place was a place to rest that Einhasad made for distinguished heroes in the Merchants period. But the problem started when Gran Kain brought unchosen heroes and several races into Magmeld.<br>Einhasad did not wish this place to escape her control. So she gave the Sword of Light to <font color="LEVEL">Paulina</font> who is the fourth daughter in order to control them. Paulina created the <font color="LEVEL">Prison of Darkness</font>, a prison made of Starlight's Lattice, and imprisoned them all.<br>
