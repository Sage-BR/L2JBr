<html><body>Eye of Argos:<br>
You put an end to Daimon's current threat, but he is not dead forever. He will resurrect one day and try to put the world in chaos once again. As long as there are organizations like <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>...<br>
Deliver my message to <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Minion Janitt</font> at the entrance of the <font color="LEVEL">Wall of Argos</font>. I still don't trust those minions, but I thank them for sending you to me. Tell them I hope they stop organizations like <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> from approaching Daimon.
