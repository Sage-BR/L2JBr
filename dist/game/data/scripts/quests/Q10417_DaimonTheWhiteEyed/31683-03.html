Wow. I'd have thought <font color="LEVEL">Daimon the White-eyed</font> would be too dangerous even for the <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font> to try and control...but they tried to resurrect him? Good thing you managed to thwart that plan!I sure am glad <font color="LEVEL">Kekropus</font> sent you.<br>
Well, things may look up now, but since the <font color="LEVEL">Eye of Argos</font> has asked me to keep the Embryo away, I'll stay here a bit longer. See ya around!
