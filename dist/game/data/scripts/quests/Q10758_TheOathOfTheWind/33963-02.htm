I see.<br>
I have a hypothesis.<br1>
If the energy from the Wind Realm is coming here through the Dimensional Rift...<br>
If the energy from the rift is mixing with the wind energy and being absorbed by the spirits...<br>
Then wouldn't the spirits respond to Ertheia even if they have lost their minds?<br>
I need to test it. Can you help me? This will be my last request.<br>
