<html><body>High Prefect Ladanza:<br>Are you familiar with the Shilen's Seal region, near the outskirts of Aden Castle? It appears that the Goddess of Destruction has opened her eyes and is strengthening her dark powers. That place, it's now infused with evil energy. There've been reports of Shilen's monsters attacking civilians.<br>
The Aden Vanguard set out to destroy the monsters their underground lair, near Shilen's Seal. But we haven't heard a peep from them since. We'd like you to lead a search party.<br>
