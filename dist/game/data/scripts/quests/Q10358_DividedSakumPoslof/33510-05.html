Excellent timing! Another guard has informed me that Poslof has been sighted near the ruined house just below that hill over there.<br>
You know what you have to do. Poslof posses just as great a threat to this area as Sakum does. I know you will be in a hurry, so I’m going to go ahead and give you the Sakum Sketch. It isn’t my best work but it is probably the best out of all the others. Once you have finished your business with Poslof you may <font color="LEVEL">deliver the sketch to the Adventure Guildsman in the Town of Gludio</font>.
