Well done! Well done indeed!<br>
You have served Einhasad impeccably... silencing the blasphemous tongue of this sad, fallen creature was no easy task but still you handled your duties to perfection.<br>
That fallen angel--no, devil is a better word--would undoubtedly have led many astray if had she not been stopped. You have done a great service for both our order and the people of this land... bravo!
