<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
We intercepted a messaged sent by Elder Casian, a lifetime supporter of the <font color="LEVEL">Revolutionaries of Dusk</font>. It appears he is attempting to render assistance to the wounded fallen angel and that... that means he must know where the creature can be found.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Elder Casian</font> is rumored to be hiding somewhere in the wilderness. I want you to go there and find him, and get him to tell you where this fallen angel is so you can rid our world of her pox.<br>
Prepare yourself both physically and mentally--although wounded, she will still be a mighty and formidable adversary. Bring me her spilt <font color="LEVEL">blood</font> as proof of your success.
