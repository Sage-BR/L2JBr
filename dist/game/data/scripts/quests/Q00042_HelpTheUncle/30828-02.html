Wonderful, you've brought it. Much thanks!<br>
So I have this uncle... one day my uncle just up and moves out north. He said he would earn cash as an adventurer.<br>
I hear he's actually pretty good, he takes on quests other adventurers couldn't. But he's family, so I'm worried. I wanted to help.<br>
And... <font color="LEVEL">You even gave me Trident</font>, but I need to ask another favor.<br>
