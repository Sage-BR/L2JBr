<html><body>Detention Camp Warden:<br>
Hey, thanks for volunteering to help out!<br>
We only recently discovered the dungeon monster camp here at the fortress.<br>
Apparently, some oldy-moldy, long-dead emperor created this place so he could use it to breed monsters for use in magical experiments. Creepy!<br>
Though, there's another legend that says it was built as a prison for criminals and evil creatures.<br>
Whatever the reason, the entrance was hidden for a very long time.<br>
Let me see what you can do to help... hmm... looks like we need <font color="LEVEL">Brand the Exile, Commander Koenig, and Gerg the Hunter</font> all eliminated. They're all members of the last <font color="LEVEL">three small groups</font> left in the <font color="LEVEL">fortress dungeon</font>. If you could clear them out, and obtain the <font color="LEVEL">Dungeon Leader Badge</font> from them, that would be fabulous.<br>
