Thank you for offering your assistance, but I don't think you are quite up to the task as of yet. You have great potential, but you need to let your skills mature a bit before you join us in this particular task.<br>
Yes, fine tune your skills, gain a few new ones... grow up a bit. You know the drill.<br>
Come back and talk to me again when you've got a bit more experience under your belt.<br>
(This quest is for characters level 85 or above.)
