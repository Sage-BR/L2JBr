<html><body>Detention Camp Warden:<br>
Enter the fortress dungeon and slay the prisoners you find there.<br><br>
Your task will be to eliminate the <font color="LEVEL">3 groups</font> so that the remaining evil creatures in the camp can be driven out. Kill the General Monster of the<br>
<font color="LEVEL">last group</font>, and bring back the <font color="LEVEL">Dungeon Leader Badge</font>.<br>
In return, I'll give you the Knight's Epaulette, which you can use to exchange the clan's supplies from a supply general.<br>
Ah, one last thing...<br>
the prisoner leaders we've identified so far are <font color="LEVEL">Brand the Exile, Commander Koenig and Gerg the Hunter</font>.<br>
I can grant you access to the fortress dungeon camp.<br>
Good hunting!<br>
