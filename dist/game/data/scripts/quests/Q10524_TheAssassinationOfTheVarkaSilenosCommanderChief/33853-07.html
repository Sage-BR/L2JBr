Thank you for your hard work. Our greatest headache <font color="LEVEL">Kampf</font> is gone, and we have even taken out the <font color="LEVEL">Varka Silenos Chief</font> who had colluded with the <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>!<br>
I'll be sure to let <font color="LEVEL">Kekropus</font> know of your role in these dealings. You will always be honored among us, the Giant's Minions. Thank you.<br>
