Because I made a promise to Mimyu.<br>One must keep their promises to fairies. Have you not heard stories about what happens to those who don't?<br>
Well, if you haven't lived for as long as I, it's no wonder you don't know. Anyway, I would like to ask you to go help Fairy Mimyu. What do you say?<br>
I'll make sure to reward you well for helping Mimyu. Well, not me, but Mimyu will.<br>
