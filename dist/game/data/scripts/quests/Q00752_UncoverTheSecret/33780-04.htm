What you need to bring are Yin's Trace an Yin's Enigmatic Trace, And believe it or not, even Golems contain Yin's  traces when infected with the virus, thought they don't have any information on Yin. Interesting, huh?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Yin's Enigmatic Trace</font> can be found in <font color="LEVEL">Spiculas 3,4,5 and 6, Twosword Golems, Screw Golems, Light Golems, and Broken-bodied Golems</font> but you can only get <font color="LEVEL">Yin's Trace</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Yin Spiculas, Spicula Elite Guard, and Spicula Elite Soldier</font>.
