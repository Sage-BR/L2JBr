My offer may be unreasonable, but I'm confident that you will be able to complete this mission.<br>
Head to the <font color="LEVEL">center of the wasteland</font>, and meet <font color="LEVEL">Guard Renfad</font>. He's chasing Sakum, and will tell you about him. I'm counting on you for this. May the power of lights be with you! I will teleport you when ready.<br>
