You must be an incredible warrior to defeat Sakum! I knew your skills weren't ordinary, and now... now I'm alive because of you!<br>

It seems like all of their energies are then sent to the heart Shine Stone located within Sakum's body. Now if the Shine Stone is a mana stone from the Time of Giants... does that mean that Sakum was created by the ancient giants?<br>
