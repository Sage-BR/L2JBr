It says that Ancient Monster Sakum, who passed Windmill Hill and was running recklessly in the wasteland, is heading to Dion Castle. A soldier has been sent there to convey the news.<br>
However, we should be alert - Sakum could easily change course and head to Gludio instead. I've stationed all our warriors and mercenaries well outside this town, and it will take at least a week for them to return. That's far too long....<br>
This is a dangerous, dangerous task, but I trust you and your abilities over any other's. Thus, the mission is yours. Defeat Sakum and you will win your <font color="LEVEL">Class Transfer</font>. Do you accept?<br>
