Sakum is now headed towards Dion! We've sent messengers to inform them, but we're not even sure they'll make it in time...<br>
We can't afford to just sit around though - what if Sakum turns and heads to Gludio? Wouldn't it just be easier to kill Sakum, instead of defending all the places he MIGHT go to??<br>
I have a mission for you, friend. It's a dangerous task, but I've been watching your progress, and believe you are ready. I want you to kill Sakum. Taking care of him will be your <font color="LEVEL">class transfer</font> task. What do you say?<br>
