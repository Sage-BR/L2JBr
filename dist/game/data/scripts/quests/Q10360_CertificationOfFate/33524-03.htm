Well, I understand your conviction, but Sakum isn't the only problem we face right now. Sakum is absorbing bio-energy by having Kanilov and Poslof regenerated.<br>
The mercenaries we have in the Wasteland are keeping them down for now, but it's only a matter of time until the tides turn. You must help, and defeat <font color="LEVEL">Kanilov</font> with <font color="LEVEL">Guard Joel</font>. Once the situation settles down, he will tell you about Sakum's whereabouts. I'm counting on you!
