That blood-pocked monster Sakum's been ravaging the Wastelands over by Windmill Hill, but now it's headed towards the Town of Dion. We contacted the town, but they don't seem to know what to do.<br>
All the glitterati in town are in full "run in circles, scream and shout," mode. Pfh! What good will that do?! Anyway, I was just wondering what I was going to do when you stopped by. I have sharp eyes for talent, and your skills have been developing at an amazing speed. I'm confident that you could defeat Sakum, if you set your mind to it.<br>
So, I tell you what... you take care of Sakum, and I will count this as your <font color="LEVEL">class transfer</font> task. What do you think? Are you ready to test your abilities?<br>
