<html><body>Grand Master Tobias:<br>
It's going to take longer than we thought for the lord to return, and all our guards are stationed outside of the town!<br>
We cannot delay though. We must stir our own hearts and steel ourselves. Sakum heads towards Dion as we speak, and we cannot simply stand by and let the great city fall.<br>
Could you help us?<br>
