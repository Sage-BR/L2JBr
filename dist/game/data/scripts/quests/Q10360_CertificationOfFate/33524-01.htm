You must be here to defeat Sakum! But... perhaps... Did you come here alone? Sigh. I see the lord has not come back yet.<br>
We need the likes of Black-haired Kenshu, Odd Eye Raphienel, and the Witch of the Battlefield Seyraka! It's apparently impossible to get help from Gludio's best knights.<br>
Still, it's up to us to make the best of the hand we've been dealt. You defeated the monsters very quickly last time, but Sakum is something else. Do you really think you can defeat him?<br>
