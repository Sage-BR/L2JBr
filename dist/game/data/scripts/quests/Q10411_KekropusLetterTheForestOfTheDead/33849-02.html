It's just a scratch. Maybe a gash. Fine! I admit it. I got mauled by a <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious Vagabond</font> with a connection to Shilen. We chased him straight into the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of the Dead</font>. But he wasn't alone.<br>
I want him to know my pain. Do you think you can tackle the <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious Vagabond</font>?<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">- Note: You can develop yourself through quests and hunting at the hunting ground in the Forest of the Dead. You can get the next item, Kekropus' Letter, at Lv. 70.</font>
