Hmm... I feel strong magical power from you. Go to the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of the Dead</font> and meet <font color="LEVEL">Tracker Hatuba</font>. Get the details from him and help him with whatever he needs. I look forward to hearing the results. <br>
To get there quickly, use the <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape: Forest of the Dead</font> I gave you, or ask a Gatekeeper for help.
