Ready already? My, my. Aren't you enthusiastic! Now then, before you head to the Museum, I'll give you some important information first.<br>
Now, take these <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots</font>. They have no grade, but as you get stronger and get better weapons, you can use Grade D, C, B, A, S, and eventually R. It's very important in battle.<br>
Your Soulshots <font color="LEVEL"> should be activated automatically</font>.
