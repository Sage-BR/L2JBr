Has Shannon sent you? I don't know how much you know, but it would seem someone after the giants' relics has been here.<br>
Since nobody has exited since I have entered, the intruder must not have been able to escape. However, before we start the search, since we cannot know how dangerous this intruder is, we must prepare thoroughly.<br>
Do you know how to use <font color="LEVEL">skills</font>? Please learn how to employ skills before you proceed, in order to be better prepared against dangers.<br>
