<html><body>Gatekeeper Elisa:<br>
We Gatekeepers use magic to Teleport long distances in a short time via the Gates of Time and Space. We've been trained in the Ivory Tower for a long time to learn these abilities.<br>
We charge you according to the distance of the teleport, as there are consumables needed for it. However, for adventurers in lower levels, we sometimes waiver the cost.<br>
