It is difficult to teleport directly to the Hamak Underground Ruins. You should take a detour. First, you must teleport to the entrance zone of the Ruins of Ye Sagira. I can help you do this. From there, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Ye Sagira</font> and then to Exploration Area 1, where you can find Giant's Minion Hadel.<br>
