However, at least, you have to know in which territory the location is, when you want to go somewhere. Is your final destination the <font color="LEVEL">Hamak Underground Ruins</font>? If you want to get there, you have to go to the <font color="LEVEL">Talking Island Village</font> first.<br>
If you are teleporting to a certain quest destination, the location will be at the top of the Teleport List so, it's more convenient. Easy, right? <br>
