In this world, there are many factions. The factions usually are based on their own regions. Sometimes, they are specialized in specific activities, such as fishing, and wield their influence. If you build relations with a faction and establish an Amity Level, you can conduct activities within the faction and take more missions.<br>
Among these factions, I am a part of the <font color="LEVEL">Adventure Guild</font>. When you implement the mission that I gave you, you'll assist the activities of the Adventure Guild. If you do well in the mission from our faction, I'll give you an even better mission.<br>
