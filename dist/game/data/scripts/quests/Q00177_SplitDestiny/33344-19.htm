Forget about the hand and focus on the foot! Same story as the hand... it most likely landed somewhere in the <font color="LEVEL">Isle of Prayer</font>. Creatures in this area that would be attracted to its power would be the <font color="LEVEL">Island Guardian</font>, <font color="LEVEL">White Sand Mirage</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Muddy Coral</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Crinaeae</font>. One of these creatures must have the foot.
