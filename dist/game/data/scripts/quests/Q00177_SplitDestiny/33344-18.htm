What did you do the hand? It's broke in so many places. I can't tell if that is a finger or a charred piece of wood, Hermuncus is going to be so mad. Alright, I think I can fix this, I just need to find out which piece goes where. Man, I'll need more time to figure this out. In the mean time, go to Isle of Prayer and find the foot of Hermuncus, and try not to break it this time.<br>
