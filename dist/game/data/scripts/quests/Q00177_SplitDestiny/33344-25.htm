Both hands and feet! Let me see. Yes, the workmanship is quite nice although there appear to be some minor blemishes here and there. It’s nothing that we wouldn’t be able to repair ourselves. I’m sure Hermuncus wouldn’t even notice...<br>
Now, the real reason why you have assisted me… you wish to receive an Ascension of Power. Before we begin, please understand my words carefully. <font color="LEVEL">You must understand that this can only be done for one subclass. The Ascension of Power cannot be reverted once it has been complete. Be sure you are on the subclass profession you wish to receive this power</font>.<br1>
Have you listened to my words? Are you ready with your final decision?<br>
