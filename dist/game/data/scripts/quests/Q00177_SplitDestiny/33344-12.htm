<html><body>Giant's Minion Hadel:<br>
It won't be easy to use the powers you received from the giant. It's amazing that you received them at all!<br>
However, I know you can do it. Stay focused. Continue your training. Then, you too can become an invaluable presence, the same way as my master was a long time ago.<br>
