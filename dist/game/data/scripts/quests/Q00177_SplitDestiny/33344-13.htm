You have freed Hermuncus’s Soul from the binding light. However, in order for him to regain his power we must restore his physical form. If you recall the last time we spoke I mentioned about Hermuncus’ fate and what happened to his body, correct? We need to find the remains of his body in order to resurrect him. If you help us, we will in turn help you with your Power of Ascension. Do we have a deal? If so your first task would be to find the hand of Hermuncus!<br>
