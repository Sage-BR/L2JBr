<html><body>Giant's Minion Hadel:<br>
Seriously? Well, this is great.<br>
We have both a foot and a hand, but they are completely useless in their current state.<br>
My current methods of reassembling these pieces failed so we are going to need someone who is a little bit more skilled in the area of reconstructing body parts of ancient extinct races, such as the Giants. I know a guy, <font color="LEVEL">Maestro Ishuma</font>, on Gludio Airship Field who can restore the pieces of the hand and foot.<br>
Bring the pieces of the hand and foot to <font color="LEVEL">Maestro Ishuma</font>. And if he brings up the subject of payment, tell him, "It's for the time that I took care of that thing." He'll know what it means. Just be sure to inspect the work before you bring them back here.
