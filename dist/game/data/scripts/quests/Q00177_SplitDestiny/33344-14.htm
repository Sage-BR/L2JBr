Yes, when Einhasad chopped off Hermuncus’ hand, it fell to the land of Aden. The power contained within the hand preserved itself by becoming petrified until it could rejoin the rest of Hermuncus’ body… Quite an amazing defense mechanism, with the exception of the whole being hacked off part. Creatures in the area would be drawn to its power and probably keep it as a trophy. Hurry to the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of the Dead</font> and collect the pieces of Hermuncus' petrified hand that the <font color="LEVEL">Vampire Berises</font> have in their possession.
