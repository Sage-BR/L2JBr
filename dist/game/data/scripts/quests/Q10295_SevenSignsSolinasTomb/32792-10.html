You met Solina? At long last her soul can rest, and so can mine.<br>
But for you, this is just the beginning. You know truth about Embryo and of the seven seals, and you must stop them.<br>
There is one last way I can help you, but first please accept this reward for putting Solina's great spirit to rest.
