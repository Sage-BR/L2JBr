<html><body>Tomb of Saintess:<br>
You look at the tomb, and see these words<br>
"For the Saintess Solina, who devoted all her life to serve Einhasad and the Elmore-Aden Kingdom...to be remembered forever by those she saved and those who loved her...may punishing find the feet of those who ignored Solina's teachings."<br>
This is not Solina's real Tomb.
