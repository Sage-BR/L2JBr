You are truly skilled to defeat the Guardians of Relics... I am impressed. Now go inside the Seal of Saintess and find your way to Solina's casket room. Use the central teleport device.<br>
To see the Holy Treasure of Solina, you will have to battle the Last Guardians, the protectors of Solina's tomb.<br>
This is the final moment before the Answer of Truth. Everything you've done comes down to this one moment. Good luck...<br>
