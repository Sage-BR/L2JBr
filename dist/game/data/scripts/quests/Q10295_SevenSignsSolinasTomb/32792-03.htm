I see. The Seal of Saintess is a protection device. It keeps Solina's resting place free from intruders.<br>
The device was invented by Sodina's 3 closest disciples, Kaerun, Anays, and myself. The Guardians protecting this place cannot be defeated without first removing the seals.<br>
I wish I could go and help you, but I cannot leave. However, when you're ready, I will send you to the Seal of Saintess.
