<html><body>Eva's Spirit Lanya:<br>
Oh, you brought Hard Leather! Thank you! But it's not over. Now I need the <font color="LEVEL">3rd material</font>, which is <font color="LEVEL">Fire Energy from the Forge of the Gods</font>.<br>
The Forge of the Gods is where the Fire Energy imbued with the power of the gods resides. I heard that Fire Energy can create very powerful weapons. Goddess Eva asked for it herself, so get moving!<br>
Now, now! Are you ready?<br>
