Let me test the strength of your soul with a task. It is rumored that the frequent wars in Aden and Rune Castle have clouded those regions' natural aura. Here is a Helping Seed to help you purify those lands. Please return after planting the Helping Seed in <font color="LEVEL">the regions shrouded by green fog</font> near either <font color="LEVEL">Aden Castle</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Rune Castle</font>. You simply target the Helping Tree Summon Device in the midst of the green fog, and use the Helping Seed. It will grow into a Helping Tree.<br>
A Helping Tree will purify its surroundings and give you <font color="LEVEL">Ashes of Remnants</font>. Bring those to me.<br>
Oh, and I will give you a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape for either Aden or Rune Castle</font>. Don't lose it, for I will only give it once.
