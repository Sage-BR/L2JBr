Thank you! A total of <font color="LEVEL">4 ingredients</font> are needed in order to make a weapon to purify the waters.<br>
First please bring us <font color="LEVEL">greenish hot spring water in the Hot Springs</font>. I will give you a bottle, so you can bring the water in there. If you go to the <font color="LEVEL">greenish hot spring</font> in the Hot Springs and <font color="LEVEL">double click this bottle</font>, water will fill the bottle.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">If you then bring the water back,</font>, I will be able to give you a summoning stone. <font color="LEVEL">Double click this summoning stone</font> to summon my subordinate, the <font color="LEVEL">Water Spirit Lanya</font>. Use this summoning stone, to receive missions from me.<br>
I will also give you a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape</font>, which can take you straight to the Hot Springs. But you should be careful -- you cannot receive it again if you lose it!
