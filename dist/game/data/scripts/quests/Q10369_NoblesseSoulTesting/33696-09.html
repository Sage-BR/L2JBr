<html><body>Eva's Spirit Lanya:<br>
You can get <font color="LEVEL">Hard Fossils Containing Water Energy</font> on the <font color="LEVEL">Isle of Prayer</font> in the Innadril Territory. The isle is filled with Water Energy.<br>
You can get Hard Fossils Containing Water Energy by catching <font color="LEVEL">Seychelles, Naiads, Sonneratias, Castalias, Chrysocollas, and Pythias</font> on the Isle of Prayer.<br>
Bring <font color="LEVEL">10</font> of them or so. The isle is very far, so I'll give you a <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape for teleporting to the Isle of Prayer</font>. Don't lose it, because you won't get another one!
