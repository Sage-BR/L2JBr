Adventurer! You have brought all ingredients! Thank you so much! I was worried I'd never be able to purify the water!<br>
I'd like to repay you for your trouble, but the reward I give is not something that everyone can receive. The weak will be killed by my gift.<br>
I would like to test your spirit first.<br>
