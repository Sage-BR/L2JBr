<html><body>High Priest Innocentin:<br>
I was visited by a <font color="LEVEL">Mysterious Dark Knight</font> one day.<br>
I am now but an empty vessel deaf to the voice of the gods, but even I could tell that this knight -- donned in dark armor from head to toe and holding a great sword -- was no ordinary warmonger.<br>
He said that if the one with the purest intentions should come to me, then I should tell them about the Fiercest Flame.<br>
