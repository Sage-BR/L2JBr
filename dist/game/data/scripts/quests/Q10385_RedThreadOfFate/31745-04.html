Thank you. How do you like the lake's waters? The sparkle under sunlight is truly breathtaking. I wonder if the <font color="LEVEL">Brightest Light</font> held by <font color="LEVEL">Nerupa</font> looks something like this. I heard that Nerupa has left the Mother Tree to go to the <font color="LEVEL">Arms of Timiniel</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Magmeld</font>. Which makes sense, as Magmeld is the only place where the Red Moon does not rise.<br>
"But...he must also miss his old home, right?"<br>
