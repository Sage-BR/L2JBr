I've been waiting for you. A <font color="LEVEL">Mysterious Dark Knight</font> had come to see me some time ago. He looked dressed in some water... err, um. Never mind. I'm just talking to myself.<br>
Anyway, this knight told me that one day I'd be visited by someone with a letter from him, someone who commands the power of the Giants.<br>
So, what do you want to ask me?<br>
