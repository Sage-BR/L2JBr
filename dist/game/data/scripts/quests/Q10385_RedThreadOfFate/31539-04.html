<html><body>Vulcan, Blacksmith of the Flame:<br>
Here are the ingredients for Mimir's Elixir.<br>
Go to the <font color="LEVEL">basement floor of the Ivory Tower where all the shops are</font>, and you will see an <font color="LEVEL">Alchemist's Mixing Urn</font>. Put in all the ingredients I gave you and mix them.<br>
On your way back here, tell <font color="LEVEL">Magic Trader Wesley</font> that I sent you. Then he will send you back here with his scroll. I have been giving him a ton of good stuff.
