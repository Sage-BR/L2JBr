Have you heard of Mimir's Elixir? It's an elixir invented by Mimir, the greatest wizard during the age of Lesser Giants. It is the source of life that gods used when creating the 5 races. With this invention of Mimir's, giants gained the power needed to create life itself.<br>
Yes, the power to create life! With Mimir's Elixir, I could bring my wife back to me...<br>
This is... just between you and I. I actually have the ingredients for Mimir's Elixir. But you can only make it with a special jar in the <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower</font>. If you go make it, I will give you what you want!<br>
