Because Dr. Chaos rubbed Nornil the wrong way, that's why! Anyway, go ask Verna for details on Nornil and Spiculas on the Isle of Souls and all that.

Whoa, been talking too long. Anyway, take this vaccine box to the <font color="LEVEL">Seal Watchman</font> guarding <font color="LEVEL">Yin</font>, will ya? Now, don't frown like that. You were helping us already, a little more couldn't hurt. I'll be sure to pay you for your troubles when you get back.
