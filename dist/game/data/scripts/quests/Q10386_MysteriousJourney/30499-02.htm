<html><body>Head Blacksmith Tapoy:<br>
Our Dwarven honor is at stake here. You see even I, the great Head Blacksmith Tapoy of the Black Anvil Guild, had to step in!<br>
Ahem. I got a bit carried away. Anyway. the Dwarf Heirarchs are troubled. Ashamed, more like. 'What are we supposed to say to Hierarch Kekropus of the Kamaels?' they said. Since, you know, being booted from Dwarven guilds doesn't change the fact that Dr. Chaos is a Dwarf. Say, I'll tell you more if you help us a bit. How about it?<br>
