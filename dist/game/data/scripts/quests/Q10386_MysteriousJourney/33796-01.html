You can't have wandered in here by accident. What a dangerously curious one you are. You asked the Dwarves about the Spiculas and the suspicious devices in this area, didn't you?  Oh, it's not that I have mind-reading abilities or anything - I've just seen a lot of people like you.<br>
You must have been really curious to come this far. What was it that piqued your curiosity so?<br>
