Going straight for the big thing, huh? It's <font color="LEVEL">Mother Nornil</font> to be exact. She is like a mother to the entire Isle of Souls and us Kamaels. It was due to her that we Kamaels were born and acquired power. You know that we were not created by the gods, right? The <font color="LEVEL">secret to our birth</font> lies in Mother Nornil.<br>
It was this secret Dr. Chaos was after when he infiltrated the place. That fool... he thought it would be that easy to get his hands on the knowledge of <font color="LEVEL">Mimir</font>, the greatest scientist to exist among the Giants? Mimir wouldn't let anyone near the secret to the Kamaels' birth so easily.<br>
