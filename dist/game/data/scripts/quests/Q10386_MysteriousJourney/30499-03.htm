<html><body>Head Blacksmith Tapoy:<br>
Dr. Chaos violated the non-aggression pact between the races. Gah, that disgraceful vermin!<br>
I don't know what <font color="LEVEL">Dr. Chaos</font> is thinking, but he took the <font color="LEVEL">Golem Corps</font> to the <font color="LEVEL">Isle of Souls</font> while the Kamaels were away. As if stealing technology from the Pavel Ruins wasn't enough...now Kamels!<br>
Now, time for you to do me a favor as promised. Take this item to <font color="LEVEL">Hesed of the Black Anvil Guild</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Harbor to the Isle of Souls</font>. It's a very important item, mind you! Hesed will repay you handsomely for your help.
