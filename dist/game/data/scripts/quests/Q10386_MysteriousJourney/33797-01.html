This place is dangerous, and don't add to my headache by poking your head where it doesn't belong. I've been trying to fix the broken Seal Device for so long now, and things just keep getting uglier. The guild's Golems keep getting <font color="LEVEL">infected</font> with the <font color="LEVEL">Laido Virus</font> - if only we hadn't run out of vaccines!<br>
