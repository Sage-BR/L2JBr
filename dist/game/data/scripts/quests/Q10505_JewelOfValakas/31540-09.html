Excellent. I can finally make my Valakas Martini. I would share with you, but given your condition of being alive I wouldn't recommend it. It has a killer bite... literally.<br>
Oh, don't look so upset... once you've become undead maybe you can try a sip, but until that time you are just going to have to accept the consolation prize.<br>
The Jewel of Valakas... a one way trip straight to the doorstep of Valakas himself. It will come in handy so you don't have to go through the business just to get there.<br>
Now if you will excuse me... its me time.
