The creature in question is called <font color="LEVEL">Karaphon</font>! Its leaves are like scales, making them very tough. The truth is, a Treant's leaves are also very good, but they can't compare to the leaves of a Karaphon.<br>
Bring me back its leaves and I'll give you something just as good. Will you go?<br>
