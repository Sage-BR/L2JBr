Hey, you wanna do me a favor? I need to get <font color="LEVEL">Karla</font> the monthly progress update on my research. Why don't you stop by and drop it off for me?<br>
It's research about fox armor. She's been looking for one ever since her fox died that day. She doesn't like to talk about it, but you can tell it eats away at her.<br>
Well, run along now! She'll see to it that you don't walk away empty-handed.
