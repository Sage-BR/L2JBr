Good.<br>
I heard that there are ways to see the ancient giants in Cruma Tower. You may ask the ones there to obtain useful information. I hope you learn information that is helpful for the Ertheia.<br>
First go to Cruma Tower and find <font color="LEVEL">Researcher Lorain</font> <font color="LEVEL">near the entrance</font>.<br>
You won't find a better helper.
