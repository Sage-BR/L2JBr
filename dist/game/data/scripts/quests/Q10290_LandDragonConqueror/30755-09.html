<html><body>Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>
If I could only give more to those who wish to take on this task... Unfortunately I have nothing more to give. Be pleased with the fact that you are one of the few who went on to take on Antharas and lived to tell the tale.<br>
(You have already completed this quest.)
