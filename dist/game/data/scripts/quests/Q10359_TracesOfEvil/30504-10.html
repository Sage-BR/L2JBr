If it weren't for the Wastelands, it might be possible to resume trade. But that's not important right now. Right now, the castle's Lord and major soldiers are not in residence. There won't be much that Bathis can do... We'll need to submit a request for additional troops.<br>
I'll see you later about that other business we discussed. It won't take long, please drop by and see me again in a while.
