<html><body>Guard Fred:<br>
I wouldn't say monsters in the Wasteland were ever very docile, but they look different now. They have became more powerful than before, too.<br>
And recently I was investigating this area and found a suspicious looking fragment from the carcass of a monster. Maybe it's because the monster has been dead for a long time, but the fragment was too small for me to identify.<br>
Could you help to discover what it might be?<br>
