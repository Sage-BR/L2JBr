I don't know much, but when you get to <font color="LEVEL">Orbis Hall</font>, go visit the medium, <font color="LEVEL">God's Messenger Lydia</font>. She's been there since, umm, forever! Go meet the hero Octavis, ask around town. But when you're done, if you're still suspicious, visit Lydia.<br>
That's all I can tell you. Now go satisfy your curiosity!<br>
