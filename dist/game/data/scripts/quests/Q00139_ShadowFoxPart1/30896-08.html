However, since you have been recommended by High Priest Sylvain...<br>
You came to assist us in the search for the angel, eh?<br>
To do so, you must join our organization as an agent. You must undertake the missions we assign you and serve our interests.<br>
We are a neutral party in political, religious and cultural conflicts, entering into contracts with any and all sides if the price is right.<br>
Agents and information dealers work independently on our clients' behalf and are sworn to secrecy.<br>
