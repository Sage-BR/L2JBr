Hmm...this key doesn't fit.<br>
Do you have any more pieces of the key or another Records Chest?<br>
If you don't, please go to the <font color="LEVEL">Field of Silence</font> and get rid of the <font color="LEVEL">Tasaba Lizardmen and Tasaba Lizardman Shaman</font> there. Once you have done so, you will be able to obtain <font color="LEVEL">both the pieces of the key to the Records Chest and the Records Chest itself</font>.
