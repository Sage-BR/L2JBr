<html><body>Watcher of Valakas Klein:<br>
Is it hot in here or is it just me? Guess that is what you get when your blood is replaced with pure liquid magma for all eternity.<br>
By the expression on your face I can tell you are wondering about Valakas, no? Heard the rumor as of late? No? Ah... you are in for a real treat then. It used to be Valakas was somewhat of a push over, no challenge to any adventurer looking for sport.<br>
Valakas has found a way to channel the energy of the Forge of the Gods and increase his power. Now many adventurers go into his lair only never to return. Now you tell me friend... are you ready to play with fire?<br>
