Before the new heroes appeared, what were the Kamael?<br>
Our founders had no interest in combat skills. With their strength, there was no one to threaten them, and when they fought among themselves, they fought for their own amusement. The sealed beings were growing in numbers and organizing, but they could not defeat the giants.<br>
So the first Kamael had the ability but not the technology. The medium we use currently for souls can be used because we are made of Mimir's Elixir. Because of this we can become more close to a soul. The giants did not give us the technology to be close to souls.<br>
