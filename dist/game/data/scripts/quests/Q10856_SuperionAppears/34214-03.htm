<html><body>Grand Master Meldin:<br>
Superiom? Can not be. The matter takes a serious turn.<br>
Now I understand why Kekropus is hiding. Oh .. But nothing. we can handle everything. No wonder my name is the Grand Master, the right hand of Kecropus.<br>
Once upon a time, at the dawn of the Kamael race, he appointed me as his assistant.<br>
So will you give Kekropus my answer? I am sure that I can trust you.<br>
Do me a favor!
