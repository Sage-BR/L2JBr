Place your hand over the owl's head, think of your message, and the Magic Owl will remember and relay it.<br>
Instead of writing a letter, the owl will fly to the person you want to send a message to.<br>
Just remember that when you're thinking about your message, don't think about anything else. Your thoughts will get relayed all mixed up. Hahaha.<br>
Would you like to use a Magic Owl now?<br>
