<html><body>Giant's Minion Lugonnes:<br>
I am interested in <font color="LEVEL">Ketra's Badges: General</font> as well. You'll find them on the Ketra Orcs, same as the Ketra's Badges: Soldier.<br>
Over time, you will be able to <font color="LEVEL">collect all the Ketra's Badges: Soldier</font>. After that, you'll have a good idea of how to collect Ketra's Badges: General from the Ketra Orcs.<br>
That's all. Understood?<br>
