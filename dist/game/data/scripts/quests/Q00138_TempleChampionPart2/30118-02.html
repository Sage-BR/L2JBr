I believe that the Temple is a vital part of our religion, but that it also is in need of reform.<br>
As you can guess, such a view has cast me into some disfavor with my superiors.<br>
I also maintain friendly relations with many prophets, something else that is in practice frowned upon.<br>
Since you occupy a high position in the service of the Temple, if you wish to speak with Prophet Sla,<br>
you will need to prove that your views are not those of the conservative Temple hierarchy.<br>
