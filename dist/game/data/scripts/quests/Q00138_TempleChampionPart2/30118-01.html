Greetings, adventurer who carries out the mission of the Temple!<br>
Do you wish to meet Prophet Sla?<br>
As you know, the prophets' goals differ somewhat from the goals of the Temple priests.<br>
Prophets believe that the Temple's rigid rules and ceremonies often serve as a barrier to a true understanding of and relationship with the goddess.<br>
And given the Temple's close association with the aristocracy, many prophets are critical that the priests are more concerned with personal status and wealth than true service.<br>
