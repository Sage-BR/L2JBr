<html><body>Employee Lupia:<br>
We would love to tell you our stories in one sitting, but we will run out of stories to tell, then.<br>
That's why we are limiting our story-teeling to <font color="LEVEL">2 times a week</font>. We are re-telling our stories on <font color="LEVEL">Wednesday and Saturday</font>. I'm sorry this is the only way we can do it...<br>
Lailly will tell you about one last point that you should know.<br>
She's over there, so go talk to her.
