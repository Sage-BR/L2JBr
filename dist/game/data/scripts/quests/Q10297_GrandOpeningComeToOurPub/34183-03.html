Alright, I'll tell you about myself. First, I'm charge of the kitchen. I'm taking care of all the food that goes to our customers. I can guarantee you that my food will taste great.<br>
The girl over there is <font color="LEVEL">Mei</font>. She's the youngest out of us, and she's a ver nice young lady. <font color="LEVEL">Brodien</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Lupia</font> rely on her a lot. I'm also glad that Mei is here with us.<br>
