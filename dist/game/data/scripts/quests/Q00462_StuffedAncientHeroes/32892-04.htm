I am sure you will. <br1> 
There is one more thing I must tell you - in order to succeed, you must also fight the most powerful of the fallen heroes. There are ten in total, ten mighty champions that saved the world while they lived, and now seek to damn it as while dead. <br1> 
Defeat the ancient heroes, and you'll summon these champions to defend them. As I said, there are 10 in total, but I will only ask that you kill two, if you can. If you can only kill one, then I will understand.<br>
Now, it's time to choose. Will you face the fate in front of you?<br>
