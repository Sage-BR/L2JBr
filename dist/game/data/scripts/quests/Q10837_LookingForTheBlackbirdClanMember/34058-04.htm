The most important thing you need to gain the trust of the Blackbird clan members is to show them that you are not the enemy.<br>
It's not enough that you are carrying the <font color="LEVEL">Blackbird Seal</font>.<br>
Defeat 60 of the <font color="LEVEL">Fortress Raiders and the Atelia Passionate Soldiers</font> and 40 of the <font color="LEVEL">Fortress Guardian Captains</font>.<br>
After that, go find <font color="LEVEL">Glenkinchie</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">1st stronghold</font>. He won't question your seal once you defeat those monsters.
