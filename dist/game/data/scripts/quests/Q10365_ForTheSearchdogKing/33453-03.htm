If I had the tonic, the king wouldn't have gotten so week.<br>
He has the habit of burying his things here and there, and he's buried the tonic he needs to take here and there as well.<br>
I've sometimes seen the monsters here find the tonic and take it with them, but me, I can't find it no matter how I try. Do you think the monsters have cleared the land of tonics? I'd be so much less worried if only I could get my hands on that tonic...<br>
