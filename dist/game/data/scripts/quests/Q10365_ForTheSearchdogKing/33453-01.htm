Oh, no. This is a big problem... this is the only one we had left...<br>
What's wrong, you ask? It's the Bloodhounds. When are first arrived, there were 10, but they all are eaten by monsters. Their king is the one that has survived, but he is weak...<br>
I have no idea what I can do for them. King, come on, recover your strength...<br>
