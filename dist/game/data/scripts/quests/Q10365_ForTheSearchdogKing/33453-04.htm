Really? Thank you so much! Then I won't have to worry until Sebion comes take the king.
<br>I don't know where the king hid the tonics, but I saw the monsters carrying them, so please get them from them.
<br>Defeat <font color="LEVEL">Husk Eyesaroch, Husk Critter, and Husk Rider</font> and bring me <font color="LEVEL">King's Tonics</font>.
<br>I'll have to feed the king with some porridge until Sebion takes him.
<br>Once you bring <font color="LEVEL">20</font> <font color="LEVEL">Tonics</font>, go find <font color="LEVEL">Sebion</font> in <font color="LEVEL">Zone 5</font>. Sebion said he will come find the king soon, so the king will be safe by then.
