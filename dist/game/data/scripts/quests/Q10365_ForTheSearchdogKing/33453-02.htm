Actually, I was going to ask someone to take the king to Sebion. However, give the king's state, I doubt he'll be able to make it there...<br>
I did send a message to Sebion, but even if Sebion devises a way to retrieve the king, with him so weak already, I'm worried that we'll be causing more danger.<br>
If I had the tonic on me, it would have been some help...<br>
