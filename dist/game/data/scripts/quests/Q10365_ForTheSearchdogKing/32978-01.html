Good, you've collected the King's Tonics! I just brought the King back here.<br>
It wasn't easy since I'd injured my leg, but I still had my magic at my disposal. It wasn't too difficult to bring the King back here. I think I should be able to take care of the King before we return to the village.<br>
Since you've collected the tonics, the King is sure to recover soon. When the King recovers his health, he will be very grateful.<br>
