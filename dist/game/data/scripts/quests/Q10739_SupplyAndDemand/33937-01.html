You're finally here. I've been waiting for you. Am I the last one? You need to receive supply boxes from 4 people, including myself.<br>
Outside town, you will find the <font color="LEVEL">Whispering Woods</font>. It was transferred from the Wind Spirit Realm along with the village. The animals and fairies there became violent as they came through the Dimensional Rift, so the Forest Patrols are watching them.<br>
You must deliver the supply box soon, so they don't get hurt doing their job.<br>
