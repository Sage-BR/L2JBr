<html><body>Armor Merchant Denya:<br>
You mean Weapon Merchant Evna? Oh! You're delivering supply boxes to the forest patrols.<br>
No offense. We can't leave our stores, so we always have to ask adventurers. I'm sure Evna told you that we always pay up.<br>
Let me ask you to deliver my Supply Box too. You will be walking a lot today. <font color="LEVEL">Pelu the Grocer</font> also has supplies.
