I like how you're quick with your answer.<br>
Take my shipment first. It's heavy because it's a Weapon Supply Box. There are good weapons inside, so don't lose it. You can come to me when you need a weapon too! I have daggers, bows, blunt weapons, everything!<br>
Now go to <font color="LEVEL">Armor Merchant Denya</font> and get other supply boxes.
