<html><body>Armor Merchant Denya:<br>
So you're about to begin a journey? I want to go out too, but I can't.<br>
But it's not like I hate my job. <font color="LEVEL">Armor</font> increases <font color="LEVEL">defense against physical attacks</font>. I take pride in helping people protect themselves. A full set of a top, pants, gloves, boots, and a helmet will help you to withstand any attacks.<br>
But you don't look like you're here to buy armor. What do you need?<br>
