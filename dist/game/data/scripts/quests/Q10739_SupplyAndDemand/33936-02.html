<html><body>Grocer Pelu:<br>
Groceries. Weapon Merchants sell weapons. Armor Merchants sell armor. What would Grocers sell?<br>
Don't make that face. Grocers sell various goods. <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape</font>, which takes you home. <font color="LEVEL">Recovery Potion</font>, when you're hurt. <font color="LEVEL">Soulshots</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Spiritshots</font> for battle. I cannot even list them all. They are mostly <font color="LEVEL">consumables</font>.<br>
What am I doing? There's no time. Here's my Supply Box. When the supplies arrive late, the Forest Patrols have a hard time. And I also get in trouble with the Queen. The Queen is not always so kind.<br>
Now go to <font color="LEVEL">Ceri the Accessory Merchant</font>. Good luck!
