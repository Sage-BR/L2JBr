Embryo used an Evil Fragment to curse Akum and steal the Kartia's Seed from him?<br>
I see. So the Magic Circle Control Device worked as I predicted. <br>
Anyway, Embryo... I didn't think the Evil Fragment had such a power. What exactly is Kartia's Seed and why did they steal it?<br>
We only have questions. I have to report this now. Thank you for helping.
