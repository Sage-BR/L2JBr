Thank you! I think I can leave the investigation with you. I will give you a piece of Akum's Memory Fragment. Take this to the <font color="LEVEL">Forsaken Plains</font> where the <font color="LEVEL">Magic Circle Control Device</font> is.<br>
By using the Magic Circle Control Device, you may be able to look into the memory of <font color="LEVEL">Akum's Memory Fragment</font> I'm not sure if it's possible, but I want you to try at least.
