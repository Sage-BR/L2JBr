<html><body>Geographer Novain:<br>
I was thinking perhaps we can find something inside Akum's memory.<br>
This is just my guess: if we could see parts of Akum's memory, we may be able to figure out why the giants have changed and why they left us the message, 'Everyone with the power of gods must stop pretending to own it.'<br>
Can you help me one more time?<br>
