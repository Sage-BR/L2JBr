Though you're a stranger to wisdom, obviously, the best way to prove your bravery would be to slay the monsters around here, correct? Slay the <font color="LEVEL">Canyon Antelope, Canyon Bandersnatch, Valley Buffalo, Valley Grendel, Canyon Antelope Slave, Canyon Bandersnatch Slave, Valley Buffalo Slave, and Valley Grendel Slave</font>. In the process, Argos may recognize your bravery. Desperate times call for desperate measures.<br>
If you feel you've done enough, teleport to where the <font color="LEVEL">Eye of Argos</font> is, and try to have a conversation.
