So you got rid of <font color="LEVEL">Belos</font>, and killed the chief of <font color="LEVEL">Ketra Orcs</font> working with  <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>, huh? What progress!<br>Of course, that doesn't mean we can let our guard down against <font color="LEVEL">Embryo</font>. They'll be up to no good somewhere else before long! <br>Anyway, I'll let <font color="LEVEL">Kekropus</font> know of your valor. We will always remember you.
