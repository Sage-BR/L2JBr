Then you'll need to prepare your fishing tools. You'll need <font color="LEVEL">Fishing Rod</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Bait</font>. You can only fish if you have them.<br>
You can receive the Normal Bait from me, but if you want to catch more expensive fish, I recommend you use the Special Bait. I have never seen Special Bait, but I heard that you can get it from the boxes you get from fishing.<br>
You can buy fishing rods from Fishing Guild Members, but I'll give you one for practice. If you already have a fishing rod, you can use that one. already have a fishing rod, you can use that one. Sounds easy, right?<br>
