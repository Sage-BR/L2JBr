One more thing! I must tell you about <font color="LEVEL">Fishing Shots</font>. It's like applying Soulshots to Fishing. When you fish, use this item to <font color="LEVEL">increase the chances of catching fish</font>. You can buy them from Fishing Guild Members and register it in the shortcuts to use them automatically.<br>
I won't give you any right now since you are practicing, but if you want to get them yourself... go ahead.<br>
That should be everything I need to explain. Let's get practicing now!
