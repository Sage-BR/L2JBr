Well.. practice is... practice, what else? You'll be having a go at fishing. Find a fishing dock, and use the fishing tools to catch a fish.<br>
Well, I'll give you the things you need. Your goal is to catch <font color="LEVEL">5 Practice Fish</font>. If you succeed, you won't be a complete newbie anymore.<br>
Oh, remember that <font color="LEVEL">practice fish can only be caught using the practice bait</font> I'll be giving you. It isn't worth much, but you'll catch them faster than normal fish, and that makes them perfect for practice!<br>
Good luck to you, then!
