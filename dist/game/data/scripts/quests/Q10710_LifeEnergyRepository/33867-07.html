Good work<br>
This came out when you destroyed the Life Energy Repository? My gods! This is a <font color="LEVEL">Shine Stone</font>, which can store life energy. Embryo have been using this to store life energy.<br>
It seems that they have gathered quite a bit already. I must report.<br>
Thank you for helping.
