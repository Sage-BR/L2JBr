There are a lot of options to make an item stronger, but the best way is <font color="LEVEL">Enchantment</font>. It's not just easier, faster, and stronger, if you succeed in enchanting the weapon higher than a certain level, there will be a sparkling effect on the weapon. Isn't that great? <br>
It isn't that difficult. Why don't you give it a try?<br>
