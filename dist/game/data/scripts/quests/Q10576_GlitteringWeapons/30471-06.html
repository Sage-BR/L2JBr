The practice mission is quite simple. Although I talked a lot about how to obtain the items necessary for Enchantment, for now, I'll supply you with the necessary supplies since it's a practice session.<br>
Here, take the <font color="LEVEL">Weapon Enhancing Practice Long Sword and the Practice Weapon Enchant Scroll</font>. Repeat the Enchantment so your Weapon's Enchantment level reaches +7. Use all of the Practice Weapon Enchant Scrolls to reach the level.<br> 
Even if you fail, don't worry. Just come back to me, as I have a Plan B. Good luck to you, then!
