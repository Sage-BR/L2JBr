I heard honey is the best for colds. You can find the honey bee habitat inside the Whispering Woods. Get 10 bottles of <font color="LEVEL">Sweet Honey</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Honey Bees</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Robust Honeybees</font>. You can collect the honey in the bottle that I give you. Also, she needs her stamina back. Please get 10 <font color="LEVEL">Nutritious Meats</font> from <font color="LEVEL">Kiku</font>.<br>
The name of my sick friend is <font color="LEVEL">Forest Patrol Leira</font>. Please don't forget.
