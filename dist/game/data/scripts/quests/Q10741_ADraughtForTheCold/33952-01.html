Oh, my. Sivanthe? Did she send me something for my cold? Does my sister know that I'm sick?<br>
Cough, cough... So, Sivanthe knew. She's going to lecture me for hours! With such a stoic face, too. Cough...Although, I guess it's better than just staring up at the sky with no one to talk to since Lorne left...cough, cough...Oh, what  am I saying?<br>
By the way, what are you doing for Sivanthe?<br>
