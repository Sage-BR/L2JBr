You've got fire in you. I like that!<br>
What material do you think will produce the strongest armor? Diamond's a strong material, but it's very expensive and hard to forge. Steel is good, but it's too heavy, and rusts easily.<br>
The best material I've found is a tree leaf! The tree leaves around here are different from other leaves. They don't decay and they're very durable. And they're light! I've been researching the leaves in the Whispering Woods for use in high-quality armor. Leaves stronger than steel! Don't you think that's amazing?<br>
