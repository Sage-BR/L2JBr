You can't produce strong weapon or armor by just banging on the ingredients for a long time. The material and the timing have to be just right in order to produce some brilliant gear. Just like how I can. Ha ha ha.<br>
Now that I see it, your armor is very poor. It's not affording you much protection, and you'll get injured eventually. Now, I am a very skilled Dwarf. Even that snooty Forest Patroller Milone acknowledges this.<br>
If I gave you some good armor, will you consider helping me with something? It's nothing bad, just gathering up some material.<br>
