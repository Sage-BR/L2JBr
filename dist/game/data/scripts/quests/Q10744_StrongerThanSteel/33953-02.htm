It's Maestro Dolkin. At first I wondered what a Warehouse Keeper was doing here. He doesn't waste even a branch on the ground. He never rests until he finishes the research he started. Are you interested? He is always whining about lack of research material. Perhaps he could get you something nice if you be nice to him.<br>
Do you want to go see him?<br>
