You are certainly strong! With this much material, I can just research for awhile. To be honest, I'm still doing research on the type of armor I want to create. Oh now, don't look at me like that. Your face will stick that way.<br>
That's not all I was going to say. I never said I wasn't going to give you any armor.<br>
I'm going to give you one that's appropriate for you right now, so don't worry.
