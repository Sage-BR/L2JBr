Have you noticed the Red Moon as of Late? A bad omen to be sure. When that moon rises it tends to cause creatures to become more aggressive. I don't know maybe it has something to do with the color of blood.<br>
The king tries to hide it but I know he is troubled by the rise in monster related attacks. Unfortunately our forces are scarce as is and I cannot afford to send any of my troops out to handle the problem.<br>
