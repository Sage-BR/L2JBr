<html><body>Captain Mathias:<br>
The Stakatos have become more aggressive lately. This is probably due to their Leader who has a taste of their own kind. Consuming the flesh of the Stakato seems to produce a chemical that causes intense aggression. It sends them in a fury to attack all those around. We don't have a scientific name for him, we just call it the <font color="LEVEL">Cannibalistic Stakato Chief.</font> Once you have taken care of this creature be sure to remove and bring me back the <font color="LEVEL">Cannibalistic Stakato Chief's Claw</font> as proof you have finished the assignment.
