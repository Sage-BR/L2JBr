So, you want to take a shot at the Varka Silenos and the Ketra Orcs?<br>
You are going to want to kill their leaders. The ones to hunt are <font color="LEVEL">Shadith and Hekaton</font> You don't need to kill them all... killing 1 should send the message. Oh, and once you are done... bring back their <font color="LEVEL">Shattered Bones.</font> as proof you have completed the assignment.
