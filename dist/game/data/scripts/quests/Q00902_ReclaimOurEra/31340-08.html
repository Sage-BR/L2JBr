The Monastery of Silence, Eh? The creature you seek is <font color="LEVEL">Anais</font>. A very powerful creature, so be careful. Just a tip... the Monks there don't like weapons. Your best off not brandishing your weapon until you find what you are looking for. Rumor has it Anais can be found near the Holy Grail. IF you know where that is, you know where to find Anais. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">Anais's Scroll</font> once you have taken care of that little problem.
