You? Well, I suppose... those scars aren't for show, now are they? It looks like you can handle yourself in a fight.<br>
We have had reports of monsters near <font color="LEVEL">Rune and Goddard</font> that have been the cause of these recent attacks.<br>
I'm not going to lie, it will be dangerous, but I will be able to reward you for your efforts... that is if you are still interested.<br>
