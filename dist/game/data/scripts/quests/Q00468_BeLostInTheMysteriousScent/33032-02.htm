We need your help to understand how the gardeners have gained control over the creatures. <br1>
I saw something a few days ago, you know. One of the creatures was becoming increasingly violent and angry, when one of the gardeners grabbed it and dragged it to the rose vines in the garden. They held them against the flowers, let them breath in the scents, and within minutes, they were sound asleep! <br1>
I want blood samples from the creatures that fell asleep. Do you think you can help?<br>
