<html><body>Selina:<br>
Well... we may never have an answer to that question. <br1> It may not be the most important, either. Instead, let me pose this question to you: if the seal to this place was broken, and we can now access its wondrous lands, what's to say other seals haven't been broken? And what's to say those seals weren't holding back far more terrifying things?<br>
It's a question that sends shivers down me.
