The creatures of the Garden of Genesis live their entire lives cut off from the outside world. That situation both protects them and protect the rest of the world FROM them. I don't know who or what is trying to get the creatures out of the garden, or why, but if they make it out Magmeld and over to the human continent... I don't know how we'll stop the carnage. So, we need to prevent it from happening in the first place! It's a good think that you came by when you did. I want you to stop these creatures! For the safety of both Magmeld and the human continent!<br>
