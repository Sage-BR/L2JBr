Ooh! You're the famous adventurer Selina keeps talking about. How exciting to finally meet you! I'm Horpina. I just came over here from the Ancient City Arcan to investigate some rumors about the Garden of Genesis. I've been standing here for a while, hoping someone would show up. I thought I could just handle this myself, but that's not going to work. Are you interested in helping? I'd love to see you in action!<br>
