Hm...I see. Well then...<br>
Oh, don't mind me, I'm just talking to myself. Anyway, this object might look shoddy, but it's actually quite remarkable. It's no mere gem. This area has statues imbued with the power of the giants.<br>

You should go find <font color="LEVEL">Wynn Summoner: Master Summoner</font>.
