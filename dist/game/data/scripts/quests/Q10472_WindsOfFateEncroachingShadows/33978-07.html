I see. You know that man, <font color="LEVEL">Hardin</font>... You think he could be <font color="LEVEL">Nidrah</font>? But if he is doing good for the races in the Ruins of Ye Sagira, I guess he could be a good man. Rumors tell me that he is a talented mage. It's strange that he's making Counterfeit Gems.<br>
Oh speaking of which, there is the Giant's Power twirling inside you.<br>
Karla! I'm sure Karla has the answers. She is the most talented one in combat in this town.<br>
I will report everything to Queen Navari for you.<br1>
Please go.
