<html><body>Black Marketeer of Mammon:<br>
Oh! Gems from the Wind Realm. It's an honor to have an Ertheia looking for such things from me.<br>
But I don't have those gems right now. They are not always available. I'm out of materials as well.<br>
If you can bring me the materials, <font color="LEVEL">%playerName%</font>, I can arrange it so that you can get the gems sooner. Can you help me?<br>
