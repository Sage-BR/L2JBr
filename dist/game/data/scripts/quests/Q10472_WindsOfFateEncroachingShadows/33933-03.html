I heard of one in <font color="LEVEL">Talking Island Village</font> who can enable others to use power not inherently their own. One with the special ability to distinguish people who can accept another's power.<br>
Wizards can become powerful warriors.<br1>
Spear-wielding warriors can acquire healing power.<br>
This individual's name was...<font color="LEVEL">Raina</font>, was it? Yes, it was Raina.<br>
(You can find <font color="LEVEL">Subclass/Dual class Master Raina</font> in Talking Island Village.)
