<html><body>Black Marketeer of Mammon:<br>
Let's see. I need the power of the wind, which I could probably get...and I also need the power of darkness. That would be <font color="LEVEL">Dark Fragments</font>.<br>
Quite unique materials, huh? I need all <font color="LEVEL">6 Attributes</font> to make this gem. In order to collect Dark Fragments, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Altar of Evil</font>. Get <font color="LEVEL">50</font> Dark Fragments from Arbitors of Darkness, Altar of Evil Spirit Offering Boxes, Mutated Cerberuses, Dartanions, Insane Phions, Dimensional Rifters, and Hellgate Fighting Dogs.<br>
(The Altar of Evil is in the <font color="LEVEL">Fog of Blood Region</font> near <font color="LEVEL">the Dark Elf Village</font>.)
