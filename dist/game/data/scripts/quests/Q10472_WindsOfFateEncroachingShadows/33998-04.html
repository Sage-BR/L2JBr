They're in all towns. Let's see, Faeron Village. Yes, the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font> would be the closest one. Of course, you can go to any of the other town too. Tell the <font color="LEVEL">Black Marketeer of Mammon</font> that you've come to buy the gemstone from the Wind Spirit Realm. I'm sure he'll be more than happy to sell it to you.
