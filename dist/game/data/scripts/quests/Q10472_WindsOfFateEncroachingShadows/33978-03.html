<html><body>Alchemist Zephyra:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Momet</font>. She's a dwarf assigned in this town. She is very friendly to us. Also she's cute and kind unlike most other blacksmiths I've treated with!<br>
She may know someone who makes or sells gems from the Wind Realm. I need to wait for Veruti's message here. You can ask <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Momet</font> for me.
