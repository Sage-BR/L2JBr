The <font color="LEVEL">Ruins of Ye Sagira</font> on <font color="LEVEL">Talking Island</font>. That place with the giants statue. What did they call it?<br>
Oh yeah, the <font color="LEVEL">Heroic Tomb</font>! The people of Talking Island Village call it Heroic Tomb.<br>
And I'll give you the gemstone of the Wind Spirit Realm, so how about we both close this business here?
