That's correct. But I am no traitor. My people are... out of their minds.<br>
The Mahums were proud warriors once. But we were driven from our homes, weak in spirit, when Shilen came among us. I thought what we were feeling was rekindled pride, but we became violently insane. Now my people are only beasts hungry for blood. Can you help them die with dignity?<br>
