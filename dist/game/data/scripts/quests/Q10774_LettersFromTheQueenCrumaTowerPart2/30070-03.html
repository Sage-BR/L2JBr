Rombel! He has extensive knowledge on giants too. He is at Underground Level 3 of Cruma Tower next to Ivory Tower Wizard Janssen.<br>
Then you just need to go to <font color="LEVEL">Cruma Tower Underground Level 3</font> and see <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower Wizard Rombel</font>. If Janssen referred him, I'm sure he can tell you how to meet the ancient giants.<br>
I hope you learn what the Ertheia need to know. May Einhasad's blessing go with you.
