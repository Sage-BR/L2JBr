The <font color="LEVEL">Altar of Evil</font> is a Hunting Zone that can be accessed by the Dark Elf Village. But, there is no direct channel to teleport from the Town of Aden to the Dark Elf Village. So, you'll have to go somewhere that has teleporting routes to the Dark Elf Village.<br>
You should go to the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font>. Once you get there, ask <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Bella</font> about how to teleport. For now, why don't you just focus on getting to the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Gludio</font>.<br>
