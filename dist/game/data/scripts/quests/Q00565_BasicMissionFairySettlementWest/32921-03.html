When setting out for a joumey, veteran adventurers always pack <font color="LEVEL">Scrolls of Escape</font>, it teleports the user immediately to the closest village or to the check point.<br>
If you have these useful items, you can move easily after hunting or when you are far away from the village. Since you've been a great help to me, I'll give you the scroll that can teleport you directly to the Town of Aden.<br>
