I could just send a sword to my sister, but I'm worried about her. I'm afraid she's in great danger on the road to Giran! Hunt <font color="LEVEL">Hobgoblin, Dion Grizzly, Dire Wolf, Ol Mahum Ranger, Monster Eye Searcher, Monster Eye Gazer, Enku Orc Champion, Enku Orc Shaman on the Dion Hills</font>. Please kill at least 30.<br>
Last night I dreamed that specters and sorrow maidens were chasing my sister. The more you kill, the better her chances are!
