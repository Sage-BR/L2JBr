The way to learn the secrets of a skill is to keep using it. The only way to hone your high-grade Alchemy is to make a lot of potions with the skills you already have.<br>
Make  <font color="LEVEL">1000</font> each of the <font color="LEVEL">Superior Windy Healing Potion, the Superior Windy Quick Healing Potion, and the High-grade Love Potion</font> and bring them to me.<br>
Don't worry -- I'm only checking. I won't take any from you, so don't complain about the amount.
