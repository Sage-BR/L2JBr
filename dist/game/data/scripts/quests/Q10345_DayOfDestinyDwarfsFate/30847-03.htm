Do you know about the region of Shilen's Seal, near the edge of Aden Castle? The Goddess of Destruction has opened her evil eyes, and is strengthening her dark powers. That place is already full of evil energy. Shilen's new monsters seem to be looking for an opportunity to take over Aden Castle.<br>
The Aden Vanguard has left to destroy the monsters in their underground lair near Shilen's Seal. We haven't heard from them since. We're about to send out a search party. Would you like to lead that team?<br>
