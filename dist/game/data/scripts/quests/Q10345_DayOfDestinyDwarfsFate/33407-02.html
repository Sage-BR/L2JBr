So many monsters have broken through our lines. Captain Adolph and his men have pushed them back through a valiant fight, but casualties were unavoidable.<br>
We must pay the dead the respect of bringing their personal possessions back to their families, but we have no numbers to spare. Please, could you bring back 4 keepsakes from the bodies of Aden Vanguard Members in the Cemetary?<br1>
It's horrible, but we haven't been able to retrieve the bodies. They're scattered all over the Cemetary, but your best bet would be to check the corners of the square guarded by the Grave Guards. It's between the Seal of Shilen and the Cemetary.
