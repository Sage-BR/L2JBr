Life only gets harder as you get older. If you are patient and industrious, and see each challenge as a new chance to grow in body, soul and name, you will do well. Hahaha! Like me!<br>
Deep within my soul, I feel that you will become something special. A great dwarf who will bring great renowned upon us all. Now, I have a mission that I want you to take on. If you are successful I will help you reach new levels.<br>
