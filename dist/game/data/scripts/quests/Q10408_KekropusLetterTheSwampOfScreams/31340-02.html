Orc Trackers were chasing after a suspicious group when they split up towards the <font color="LEVEL">Swamp of Screams</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Forest of the Dead</font>. The Orc Trackers also divided into two groups and chased after them separately. But now they are asking for help. I think both of the groups have run into problems.<br>
