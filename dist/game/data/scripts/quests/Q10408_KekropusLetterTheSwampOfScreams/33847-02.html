I laugh in the face of pain. Hah! It took a <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious Vagabond</font> and all his friends to take me down. We chased him in to the <font color="LEVEL">Swamp of Screams</font>, believing he had some connection to Shilen. He wasn't hard to track. That should've been our first clue.<br>
It was a trap! But no more. The <font color="LEVEL">Suspicious Vagabond</font> will never harm another. Not if you go after him.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">- Note: You can develop yourself through quests and hunting at the hunting ground in the Swamp of Screams. You can get the next item, Kekropus' Letter, at Lv. 70.</font>
