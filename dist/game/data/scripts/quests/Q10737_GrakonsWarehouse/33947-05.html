If you yourself ever need to store something in the <font color="LEVEL">warehouse</font>, you're always welcome to come back. Of course, it's not free -- there's a small <font color="LEVEL">fee</font>.<br>
Just as long as you don't go abusing my services like somebody we know. You can even send <font color="LEVEL">mail</font> to a friend. If I'm ever unsure about keeping or discarding something, I'll mail it to a friend. Haha!
