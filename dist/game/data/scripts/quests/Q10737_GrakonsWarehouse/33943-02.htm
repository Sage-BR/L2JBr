You've never met them? Many came from Aden to help us settle here. Gatekeepers, who help us to go to other areas. Adventurer's Guide, Auction House Manager, Mentor Guides, and Warehouse Keepers...I can't even list them all.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Warehouse Keeper Grakon</font> is the best! Too much stuff in the inventory is too heavy. Warehouses always come in handy.<br>
Speaking of which...I cannot leave my post. Will you give Grakon some of my stuff?<br>
