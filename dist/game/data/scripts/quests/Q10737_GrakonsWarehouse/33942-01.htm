The more Ertheia there is coming here, the more I train. There are many things I need to prepare in order to take care of them all.<br>
I'll need plenty of Spiritshots.<br>
Of course, I'm not the only person trying to help. Some people have been sent from the continent to the administrative area.<br>
Want me to tell you about them?<br>
