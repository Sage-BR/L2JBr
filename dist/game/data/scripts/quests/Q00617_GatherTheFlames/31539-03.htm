<html><body>Vulcan, Blacksmith of the Flame:<br>
Very well! Let me ask you a favor! Bring me <font color="LEVEL">1000 Flames</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">monsters inside the Forge of the Gods</font>. I'll give you a Weapon Recipe: Grade S that I have.<br>
Oh, I just remembered that my younger brother, <font color="LEVEL">Rooney</font>, also collects Flames in the Forge of the Gods. He's a wanderer, that boy! I've heard that <font color="LEVEL">he gives a Weapon Recipe: Grade S to anyone who brings him 1200 Flames</font>, but he probably won't be easy to find!
