<html><body>High Priest Gereth:<br>
The way to the grail...<br>
I think I can guide you there. The moment I was born, and the moment I became a priest of Sayha, Sayha taught me a single line of prayer...that prayer will certainly lead you to your destination.<br>
Now. You should go. I will find <font color="LEVEL">Kain Van Halter</font> and tell him where you went. I will send you to the Chamber of Prophecies.<br>
