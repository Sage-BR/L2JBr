It all started when research began on an ancient meteorite, and as its scale grew, the site became the main temple of wizards in the Material Realm. They already have something akin to our Alchemy, I hear. Go to this tower, and erase the traces of the Material Realm's magic from the Prophecy Machine.<br>
The journey to Ivory Tower won't be easy, but the trails you face along the way should prepare you for your 3rd Liberation.<br>
Also, you're curious about the content of the prophecy too, right?<br>
