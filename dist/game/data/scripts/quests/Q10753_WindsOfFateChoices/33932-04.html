<html><body>High Priest Gereth:<br>
<center><font color="LEVEL">A day will come, when</font><br1>
<font color="LEVEL">Trapped under twisted skies, the god's voice no longer heard,</font><br>
<font color="LEVEL">A red river flows over hard frost upon the earth.</font><br><font color="LEVEL">And One of half-noble blood, descending with the winds to deliver from torment, will come.</font><br1>
<font color="LEVEL">The journey was started alone, but<br1>
For the child of the Wind, standing at a dead end,</font><br1>
<font color="LEVEL">When joined by one of nobility,<br>
The path will open to the Grail.</font>.</center><br>
So it wasn't a coincidence that you left on your journey.<br>
