It's the headquarters of the Material Realm wizards, who first started out by studying the rocks from the ancient meteorites. I heard that they have similar magic to our Alchemy.<br>
I need you to go there and remove the traces of Material Realm's magic. You're the one who found the machine, so you're perfect for this job.<br>
By the time you're back from Ivory Tower, you will be ready for your 3rd Liberation. That's how difficult this mission is. Are you interested?<br>
