You'll find an <font color="LEVEL">Alchemist's Mixing Urn</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Underground Shopping Area in Ivory Tower</font>. I'll give you an Empty Reagent Flask and a <font color="LEVEL">Crude Philosopher's Stone</font>, so take these and combine them in the Alchemist's Mixing Urn.
