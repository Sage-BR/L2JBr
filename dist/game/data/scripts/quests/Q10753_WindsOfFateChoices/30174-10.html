<html><body>Grand Magister Arkenias:<br>
There is a way, but...well, I did promise to help. Just don't tell anyone that I told you this.<br>
Ever heard of <font color="LEVEL">Hardin</font>? He's a wizard from the Ivory Tower, back from the time of Elmoreden.<br>
He was extraordinary in talent, but his ambitions reached too far. Far enough to get his hands on dark magic.<br>
You can find him at <font color="LEVEL">Hardin's Academy</font>. Well, I'll be on my way, then.
