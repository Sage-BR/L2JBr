Oh my! Is this not Atelia? This is scarce even in the Wind Realm. Where did you get this? This is very difficult to come by in the Material Realm. You brought the Prophecy Machine back, you overcame obstacles... you must be the Child of Prophecy. You have brought the Atelia to me with an innocent heart. I cannot ask this from you. It was your fate to come across it. But this Atelia seems different. I can sense disharmony in it, which I cannot quite explain. Is it because it's from the Wind Realm or because it has too much magic power stored inside?<br>
Anyhow, I cannot just take this Atelia from you. Surely, it was not a coincidence you came across it.<br>
