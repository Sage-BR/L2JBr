The Ivory Tower is built inside a crater created by an ancient meteorite called Nebulite. Nebulite has a property that amplifies magic, so much so that it attracts monsters that are drawn to magic.<br>
Monsters that are particularly sensitive to Nebulite will also undergo changes upon exposure.<br>
Go collect some special ingredients from these monsters.<br>
Get a <font color="LEVEL">Crystal Eye</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">Nebulite Eye,</font> a <font color="LEVEL">Broken Stone of Purity</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">Nebulite Watch,</font> and a <font color="LEVEL">Miracle Drug of Enchantment</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">Nebulite Golem.</font>
