You need to dye this white rose crimson with the <font color="LEVEL">Blood of Eva</font>. What's with that face? You think I want you to kill her? Haha!<br>
Don't worry. <font color="LEVEL">Sorceress Athrea</font> has the Blood of Eva. As long as you pass her test, it won't be a problem. They are not difficult...just a bit mischievous.
