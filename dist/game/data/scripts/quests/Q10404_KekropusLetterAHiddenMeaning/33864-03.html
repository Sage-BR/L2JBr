Why, thank you so much! You seem like a reliable sort, and I need someone to move forward with this investigation. <br>
If you go to the <font color="LEVEL">Fields of Massacre</font>, you'll find <font color="LEVEL">Shuvann</font>. He's not a great fighter, but has more knowledge about that place than anybody. If we are going to stop Embryo, you must help him. If you use the enclosed <font color="LEVEL">Scroll of Escape</font>, you'll get there much quicker.
