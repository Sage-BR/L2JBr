Kekropus... Kekropus. Sounds familiar. But since you're here, I could use some help. From the clues and evidence I've assembled, I found out that Embryo neither works for Shilen nor uses her power. What they want is... the power of Giants! <br>
I am now convinced that we will soon find some complicated plan that explains all of this. But for now we need some answers in order to stop Embryo.<br>
