<html><body>Elder Green:<br>
I'm Green from the Red Libra merchants. I've been together with them since Red's grandfather was in charge. I'm old and very experienced.<br>
We visited Talking Island Village before arriving in the Town of Giran. I met Raina there, and she told me about the dual class.<br>
That's how I came to realize something about the dual class. And I found the secret behind reawakening the dual class.<br>
