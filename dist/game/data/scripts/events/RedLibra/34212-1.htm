<html><body>Artisan Black:<br>
I'm Black, and I deal with the great weapons of the Red Libra merchants. I'm the best in the world at creating and repairing weapons. I'm a master.<br>
I heard about the Mammon blacksmiths, but I can guarantee you that I'm much better than them. I can change those <font color="LEVEL">R-grade weapons</font> into <font color="LEVEL">other types</font> as well.<br>
I'm also selling <font color="LEVEL">Elysium weapons</font>. Mind you, I'm the only one in the world who can make them.<br>
