Raina isn't as experienced, so she can't maintain a character's level when reawakening the dual class. However, I, am experienced. When <font color="LEVEL">reawakening the dual class</font>, I can <font color="LEVEL">let you keep your level</font>. However, instant reawakening does come with its flaws. You'll have to learn the skills yourself.<br>
In order to rewaken your dual class, bring <font color="LEVEL">your current dual class' cloak</font>, <font color="LEVEL">1 Proof of Red</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">667 Gemstones (R-grade)</font>. I'm a merchant, so no free passes here.<br>
You need <font color="LEVEL">Red Tears</font> in order to work with us. Talk to <font color="LEVEL">Bodyguard Blue</font> and help him to get some.<br>
