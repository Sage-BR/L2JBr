<html><body>Bodyguard Blue:<br>
I'm Blue, a bodyguard of the Red Libra merchants. I go to the most dangerous places.<br>
I'm the only bodyguard that accompanied the merchants this time. We are in charge of going ahead of the group and dealing with monsters, but since I'm the only one here now, we haven't been able to go through.<br>
That's why I'm looking for people to help us out. I'll give you something that will allow you to trade with one of our merchants in exchange. Interested?<br>
