I was so surprised when I first saw the dyes in Aden. That's why I'm trying to collect as many as possible. I'm trying out different techniques with those dyes. Sell those to me, and I'll give you a <font color="LEVEL">Rudi</font>, which is a mixture of those dyes.<br>
If you have <font color="LEVEL">Rudies</font>, I can create some great dyes from those. I can use Rudies to create <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 5 Giant Dye Packs</font>. I can create <font color="LEVEL">10</font> at a time.<br>
One thing to keep in mind though is that the Rudies are a combination of various dyes, so the type of dye I can create is random. Anyway, are you up to test your luck?<br>
