Elysium weapons can only be created in Elysium. They are great weapons. There's one issue with them though. They can only be used while we are staying here, since the weapons are greatly affected by Elysium.<br>
Once we leave, the Elysium weapons will also disappear. But I can guarantee that the weapons will be amazing.<br>
It's very precious, so I can't just give it to you for free. Just give me <font color="LEVEL">1 Scroll: Enchant Weapon (R-grade)</font>. Pretty cheap, right?<br>
