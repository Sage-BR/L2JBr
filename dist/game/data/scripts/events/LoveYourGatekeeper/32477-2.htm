You can use the Gatekeeper Transformation Stick to transform yourself to look like us for an entire hour!<br>
When you use the Gatekeeper Transformation Stick to look like us, you will possess our great powers and you will gain vitality while hunting. It's fantastic!<br>
You can obtain a Gatekeeper Transformation Stick once a day per account for a donation of just 10,000 Adena.<br>
All proceeds go to the Gatekeeper Welfare Foundation, so please participate early and often!<br>
Please know that during the transformation, your physical form and your attributes will change.<br>
