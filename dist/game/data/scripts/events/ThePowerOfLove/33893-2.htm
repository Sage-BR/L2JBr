A monster stole the <font color="LEVEL">Love Potion</font> I made! It was my blood, sweat, and tears!<br>
A sip of it will <font color="LEVEL">double the P. Atk./ M. Atk./ Speed/ Casting Spd. for 2 minutes</font> for <font color="LEVEL">everyone in your party</font>! Awesome, right?<br>
I wouldn't call this a side effect, but the potion does tend to change the appearance of your weapon a little. But don't worry, because it's not ugly! I'm the messenger of love, remember?<br1>
(The effect of the Love Potion disappears when you restart the game.)<br>
Also, you can choose <font color="LEVEL">Chocolate Truffle, Candy Heart, or Comfort Cookie</font>. Each one <font color="LEVEL">restores your Vitality in peace zones</font> and has <font color="LEVEL">also has its own special power</font>.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Chocolate Truffle</font> lets you use the <font color="LEVEL">Decadence</font> skill, resulting in STR + 2, INT + 2, and Attribute Resistance + 20.<br>The <font color="LEVEL">Candy Heart</font> lets you use the <font color="LEVEL">Sugar Rush</font> skill, increasing STR + 2, INT + 2, DEX + 2, and WIT + 2.<br>The <font color="LEVEL">Comfort Cookie</font> lets you use the <font color="LEVEL">Forever Alone</font> skill, increasing STR + 2, INT + 2, CON + 2, and MEN + 2. If 3 people with each item gather around and use their skills, they can receive <font color="LEVEL">all of the effects</font>, so you might want to go looking for new friends! The skills were made from leftovers from the Love Potion, so they might look a bit, uh, excessive... But hey, they're cute, I promise!<br>
Oh, and you know about the transformation and summoning items, right?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Transformation items</font> let you transform into either a Snow Man, Scarecrow Jack, Tin Golem, Makeshift Bat, Angry Tow, Lady Tow, or Sleepy Tow. What's so great about them, you say? Well, they're cute! So insanely cute!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Friend-summoning</font> items let you summon your friends. Create a party, and use the items to summon a party member! Easy, right? Well, that's it! Have a very sweet day!<br>
