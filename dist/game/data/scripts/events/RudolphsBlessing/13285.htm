Have you heard about the Santa privilege?<br>
Apprentice Santas spend a lot of time taking care of weak Rudolphs.<br>
Raising a healthy Rudolph is very important to us.<br>
But during the Christmas season, we don't have a lot of time to spend taking care of the Rudolphs.<br>
This year, one apprentice Santa came up with a good idea. We would give people the gift of taking care of a weak Rudolph. It's a great idea, don't you think? We thought it would also give people the gift of joy in doing something good.<br>
Well? Are you interested in this Santa present?<br>
