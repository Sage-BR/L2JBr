Hahaha... Good!<br>
Rudolph likes to eat <font color="LEVEL">"Fresh Herbs"</font> If you feed it this herb continuously, it will grow into a strong Rudolph. You can find the herbs while hunting without much difficulty.<br>
When Rudolph's energy runs low, it will go into your pack, find the herb, and eat it. Remember that he'll want to eat about every 10 minutes.<br>
Also, every time Rudolph eats the herb, it will cast a beneficial spell on you to show you its thanks.<br>
Finally, you have to donate 2019 adena to receive a weak Rudolph. How should I say this... Think of it as your annual donation to help the less fortunate.<br>
