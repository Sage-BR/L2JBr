Let me tell you how to hatch a <font color="LEVEL">Small Draco Egg</font>.<br>
Remember, <font color="LEVEL">you can hatch a Small Draco Egg by yourself</font>.<br>
Summon the <font color="LEVEL">Small Draco Egg</font> in your inventory. It will appear with a base temperature of <font color="LEVEL">16 degrees</font>.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Flame Spirit Agathion</font> can use <font color="LEVEL">Pa'agrio's Hand</font> on the <font color="LEVEL">Small Draco Egg</font> to raise its temperature. But this is not always easy! Even the Flame Spirit struggles to wield Pa'agrio's Hand. <font color="LEVEL">The temperature increase may be anywhere between 1 - 10 degrees</font>.<br>
The egg should hatch between 26 - 36 degrees. It will definitely hatch if the temperature hits exactly <font color="LEVEL">37 degrees</font>. After that point, though, it will break!<br>
Draco researchers say <font color="LEVEL">the closer the temperature is to 37 degrees, the more likely it is to hatch</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Oh! One last thing. When you're in a party, your Draco Egg will be summoned at the same time as your other party members' eggs!</font><br>
