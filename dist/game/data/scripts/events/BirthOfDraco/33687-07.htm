Let me tell you how to hatch a <font color="LEVEL">Large Draco Egg</font>.<br>
First, <font color="LEVEL">it takes a party to hatch a Large Draco Egg</font>.<br>
Second, summon the <font color="LEVEL">Large Draco Egg</font> from your inventory. It will appear with a base temperature of <font color="LEVEL">16 degrees</font>.<br>
Third, have the <font color="LEVEL">Flame Spirit Agathion</font> use <font color="LEVEL">Pa'agrio's Hand</font> to raise the egg's temperature. But be warned! Even the Flame Spirit has a hard time handling Pa'agrio's Hand. <font color="LEVEL">The temperature increase may be anywhere between 0.1 - 1 degree</font>.<br>
Fourth, the egg should hatch between 36 - 36.9 degrees with room for failure. It will definitely hatch if the temperature hits exactly <font color="LEVEL">37 degrees</font>. But it will break if you exceed that temperature!<br>
Draco researchers say <font color="LEVEL">the closer the temperature is to 37 degrees, the more likely it is to hatch</font>.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Oh! One last thing. <font color="LEVEL">When you're in a party, your Draco Egg will be summoned at the same time as your other party members' eggs</font>!</font><br>
