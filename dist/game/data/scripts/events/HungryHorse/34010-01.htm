What a strange place! Even my great clan is unknown here.<br>
Aden, is it? Beh. All these dimensions twisting around... thanks to that, I fell while flying. And I lost all my carrots!<br>
I was raised in a proud family, so I only eat organic. That means I have a hard time finding food...<br>
Do you know if there are any carrots around? Organic, of course.<br>
Or better yet, how about you bring me the carrots? I'll give you something nice in return!<br>
