Multisells contain information about "special" shops that require any kind of item to be
given in exchange for purchasing another item.
Items given by the player are referred to as "ingredients".
Items rewarded by the NPC are referred to as "products"
Each entry in a multisell can have many ingredients and many products.

All multisell files have a NUMERIC filename which corresponds to the ID of the multisell, followed by .xml
Multisell lists can be shown by linking them from an html using: 
	<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_exc_multisell 123456">
OR
	<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_multisell 123456">
where 123456 is the id of the multisell (this would show the contents of file "123456.xml")
The difference between these two links is as follows:
npc_%objectId%_multisell displays a FULL multisell.  That is, all of the entries of the xml are shown exactly 
as defined.
npc_%objectId%_exc_multisell displays an "inventory only" multisell.  That is, it looks through the player's 
inventory for weapons and armors (not equipped) and it only shows multisell entries that have these weapons
and armors as ingredients!

Each multisell file defines a "list"
A list can have the following attributes:
1) applyTaxes
	optional; default value is "false"
	if set to true, then all adena amounts in the multisell are taxed (and the tax dollars go to the
	owning castle).  Also, 5/6 of ancient adena amounts are taxed in adena.  For example, a taxable 
	list with 10% tax, containing an entry that requires 3600 ancient adena will actually require
	3600 ancient adena AND 300 adena!  That is:  (10%)*(5/6)*(3600)
2) maintainEnchantment
	optional; default value is "false"
	if set to true and the list is shown in FULL mode, it is ignored (works as "false")
	if set to true and the list is shown in "Inventory only" mode, then any weapons and armors defined
	as products will have the same enchantment level as the weapons and armor that the player gave as 
	ingredients.  For example, in an SA addition multisell, if the player gives a Crystal Staff +3, 
	the player will receive a Crystal Staff with Body Bless +3
