<html><body>Pet Manager Lemper:<br>
Hmm... Recently I heard a rumor that some group is organizing in order to collect Drake and Wyrm eggs. Tsk! Sure, Hatchlings are fine pets, but it's a different story they become Striders. Only one thing that I can think of that makes sense: somebody is trying to create a cavalry unit composed of Striders!<br>
