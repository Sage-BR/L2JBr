You can evolve your pet depending on its type. Evolution is available only when the pet is summoned, and since it transfers XP, the level might decrease when you evolve a pet with a high level.<br>
The name of the pet will remain, and the items in the pet inventory will be transferred to the owner's inventory.<br>
Which pet do you want to evolve?<br>
