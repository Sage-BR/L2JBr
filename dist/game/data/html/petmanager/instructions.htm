You should know some things before raising a pet.<br>
First, you should know how to acquire a pet's experience. A pet acquires a portion of XP that the master obtains. At that time, depending on whether the master's level is higher or lower than the pet's level, the amount of XP taken by the pet will differ.<br>
Also, when a pet dies, you must resurrect it within 24 hours, or it will be lost permanently. So if your pet dies, resurrect it quickly.<br>
A pet grows on pet food. If it becomes hungry, the pet will not move normally.<br>
If the hunger gauge falls below 50%, pets get very hungry. In this condition, the pet's moving speed and attack speed will decrease. Also, a hungry pet cannot be returned to its pre-summon condition.<br>
When the hunger gauge falls to 0%, the pet is completely starved. If this happens, the pet loses faith in you as a result of its hunger. It will not obey your commands and it will just follow you around. Also, it cannot acquire the given XP and cannot advance. So feed your pet!<br1>
In order for the pet to start obeying your commands and to start advancing, the pet's hunger gauge must be raised to at least 1%.
