<html><body>Mysterious Letter:<br>
One blessed with a power long hidden...misguided is your delight to awaken to a world free of the yoke of the gods, for your awakening will prove to be a new yoke in itself. <br>
Only with your own strength may you cast away that yoke again...follow the lead of one who is bound to you by the Red Thread of Fate.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">The Clearest Water,</font><br1>
<font color="LEVEL">The Brightest Light,</font><br1>
<font color="LEVEL">The Purest Soul,</font><br1>
<font color="LEVEL">The Fiercest Flame,</font><br1>
<font color="LEVEL">The Fondest Heart</font><br>
 - collect these all, and bring them to the <font color="LEVEL">Place of Fondest Memories</font>.<br>
Take the Red Thread of Fate in your hands, and set off to find the Clearest Water. Go to Eva's Temple in <font color="LEVEL">Heine</font> and ask <font color="LEVEL">High Priestess Morelyn</font> for directions.<br>
