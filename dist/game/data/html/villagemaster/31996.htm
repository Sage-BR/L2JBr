<html><body>Grand Magister Javier:<br>
Welcome. Welcome, I'm called Grand Magister Javier. Ah, I spoke too loudly, didn't I? I apologize. Whenever I see warriors as young and dashing as you, I can't help getting excited. My voice goes all squeaky.<br>
Haha. May I have a guess at what you were thinking just now? You were thinking that this one is quite giddy for a Grand Master.... I guessed right, didn't I? Even so, I love talking to young warriors who get to travel across the various lands.<br>
But don't you worry. I haven't forgotten what my duties are.<br>
