<html><body>Grand Master Rivian:<br>
Welcome to the Elven Embassy. I am the ambassador, Grand Master Rivian!<br>
The more I see of this place, the more it reminds me of my home, Innadril. We have a large population, a bustling economy, ample supplies, even a hidden conspiracy...<br>
I do not think it was an accident that we Elves -- and myself in particular -- are here at this moment in time. I feel the threads of our collective destiny pulling tight...<br>
