My Orc comrade! Are you ready to be reborn, through blood and fire, as a true warrior of our kind?! Hmm? I'm so tired of having to put up with those snarky Dwarves and Elves!<br>
To regain our former glory, we need Schuttgart Territory. It's in a key strategic position for the Kingdom of Elmorean. If the Orcs unite, it'd be easy to occupy the place. It's practically defenseless! Garaghaa! Stoke up your smoldering vengeance! The time to strike is fast approaching!<br>
