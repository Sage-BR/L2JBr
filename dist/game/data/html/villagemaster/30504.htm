Welcome to Gludio! I'm Head Blacksmith Mendio of the Black Anvil Guild. Have we met before? Hmm?<br>
With all sincerity, I can honestly say that without the Black Anvil Guild human civilization would have stagnated! You don't believe me? Do you really think the races could wage war without blacksmiths? Not a chance! Without our siege golems and weapons, warriors would be flailing at each other with sticks and stones instead of solid steel!<br1>
Ah, my apologies for the lecture, sometimes I get a wee bit carried away. What can I do for you?<br>
