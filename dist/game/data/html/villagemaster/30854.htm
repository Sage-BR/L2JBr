Urrgh... my head. It must be true what they say about the Dreviant vintners putting spider venom in their wine. Penny-pinching sadists! Can't be that I drank too much, no. I would've, but that Sedrick must have drunk three bottles by himself...! That old Dwarvish geezer! And Desmo's no better! Deserves some kind of award for his champion drinking last night.<br>
Ugh, well... I'm Grand Master Drikiyan of the Magicians Guild of the town of Aden. I am Grand Master Drikiyan. I suppose I need to help you with something?<br>
