<html><body>Warehouse Chief Rikadio:<br>
Hey there, traveler! Pleased to meet you; I am Warehouse Chief Rikadio of the Steel Door Guild here in Gludin. You've heard our motto, right? "Sell anything to anyone, anywhere." We'll travel to frozen wastes, burning deserts, even the dangerous volcanic zones of the north, for the sake of plying our trade. Ha! Who can match that? Tell me, my friend, have you come here in order to become a member of our guild?<br>
