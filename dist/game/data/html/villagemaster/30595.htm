<html><body>Head Blacksmith Opix:<br>
I'm Head Blacksmith Opix of the Black Anvil Guild here in the Gludin territory. In all sincerity, I can tell you that without the Black Anvil Guild, Human civilization would still be in a very primitive condition. Do you think the races could march out to war or lay siege to enemy cities without us? Not a chance! Without our siege golem and weapons, warriors would be forced to fight with sticks and stones instead of steel. How foolish would they seem then!<br>
Ah, but I didn't intend to lecture you. My apologies. What is the reason for your visit, then?<br>
