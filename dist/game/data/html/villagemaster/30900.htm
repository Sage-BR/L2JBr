<html><body>Grand Master Marcus:<br>
Heine is one of Innadril's most beautiful cities, but you must never let your guard down, youngster, despite its beauty. Remember that Devil's Isle and the Garden of Eva are close at hand. Ah, and Fafurion's Island as well... They say that long ago, after being wounded by young Lionel Hunter, Fafurion cursed each and every stone in Innadril... How can even the Grand Master of the Warriors Guild not be constantly on guard?<br>
