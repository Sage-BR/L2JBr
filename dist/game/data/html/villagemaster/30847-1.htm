Have you heard of the crystals that contain the desires of spirits? They've been appearing in various places throughout Aden, and the elders and blacksmiths found out that they can be used to increase the level of equipment.<br>
I learned from the elders how to bring out the power from the crystals, and I'm able to upgrade equipment with that. Are you ready?<br>
