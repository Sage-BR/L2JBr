Oh my, oh my! A new student, come to visit me in my Ivory Tower. So glad to see you! Are you here to learn how to manipulate elemental powers? Hmm? You must be... there's no other reason to come. I do only one thing here, I mold wizards into high-level sorcerers. You might call it my passion... or perhaps, my obsession. Depends on who's talking! Ha!<br>
