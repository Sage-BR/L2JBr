<html><body>Grand Master Siegmund<br>
What do you think, young one? As a training opportunity, would you care to match your skills against the masters of this place? Although their teaching style is a little rough, I can promise it is very effective.<br>
Worried about getting hurt during training? Ah! A Magister can be quickly called from the library over there to cast a cure spell, should that be necessary.<br>
