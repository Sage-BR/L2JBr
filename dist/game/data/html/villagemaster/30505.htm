<html><body>High Prefect Drikus:<br>
The eternal fires of Pa'agrio have called me to teach the Orcs. It is my duty, and my honor, to help our race regain the glory that was once ours! You, young Orc warrior, you are like a tinderbox. A tiny spark who will grow to become a great blaze! In you I see the pride of our Orc tribe! How may I be of service to you?<br>
