<html><body><center>[R-grade set option]</center><br>
Our Blacksmith guild endows R-grade armor with a set option or changes the existing set option of R-grade armor at a low price on behalf of you.<br>
You can endow R-grade armor with a set effect. When wearing multiple pieces of armor with the same set effect, you may receive various abilities.<br>
If you don't like the option which has been already endowed, we will change it at any time. Please trust in our blacksmiths.<br>
You may entrust your precious armor to our Blacksmiths. They have a long-standing tradition of integrity.<br>
We will do our best to serve you.<br>
