Then you do not really need the Guild's help. The world has changed a great deal in the last year, you know, what with the introduction of Shadow Items -- they have dramatically altered the economic environment for adventurers. We are used to the new environment, but the Guild has decided that those "dormant adventurers" may need some help to adjust.<br>
If you know anyone who has been away for more than 1 year, please let them know that Aden needs them... and that the Guild will support them.
