Then go and search the warehouse for <font color="LEVEL">Exchange Coupons</font> for the Shadow Item and the Welcoming Armor.<br>
Because of Guild policy, I cannot give you the Shadow Item or armor unless you first bring me the Exchange Coupon. You can also exchange the coupon for the Sergeant's Flag or other supplies.
