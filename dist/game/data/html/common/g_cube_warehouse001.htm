<html><body> Ever heard of the <font color="LEVEL">Wondrous Cubic</font>? It's the fruit of our guild's labor! It can produce all kinds of <font color="LEVEL">Cube Fragments</font>!<br>
But the thing is, you can't really use this item more than once a day. You see where this is going? So you get me some of these fragments, and I give you scrolls and items in exchange -- how about it? If you don't have the Wondrous Cubic, go to Helvetia in the Village of Giran, and she'll tell you all about it.<br>
(Cooldown for the Wondrous Cubic resets at 6 am.)<br>
