These aren't birds that live in bushes. These magpie brothers are not so cute. Originally they were of the Dwarven guild that specializes in searching ruins and collecting relics but they began stealing from the tombs of kings. They were expelled from our tribe when their foul deeds were discovered. They formed a new guild of grave robbers. Now they make no distinction of race when digging up the graves of past royalty. They have plundered many of the graves at the Cemetery.<br>
I don't understand why the ghosts don't deal with those vile creatures. Really!<br>
