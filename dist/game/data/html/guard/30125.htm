Do you see the great mountain range to the north? The range forms two lines to the east and west, but we call it the Dragon Valley. It's called that because they say the <font color="LEVEL">land dragon Antharas</font> nests at the end of the range. Well... it's such a dangerous place that I don't know if I'd advise you to go there.<br>
