Young traveler, welcome to the most historic village in Gludio! This is the first village that the Humans established after moving to this area and driving out the lizardmen and the orcs. We have been through great misfortune, such as the domination of the demon Beleth and the battle with Gracia, but each time our people have defended this village with courage and spirit.<br>
