<html><body>Guard Luis:<br>
Somewhere in that wide field that stretches out before me, the demon <font color="LEVEL">Beleth</font> lies asleep. I heard that the reason the south of Gludio became the Wasteland and the insects and spiders grew monstrously large is because Beleth breathes out foul magic as he lies sealed underground.<br>
Recently, the <font color="LEVEL">giant ants</font> have begun openly foraging out of the Wastelands and are giving our guards headaches.<br>
