Humans and Elves have lived alongside each other peacefully for years in this land. Here, Eva is more revered than Einhasad. The aristocracy tend to worship Einhasad and the rest of us worship Eva. Our special name for her is "The Lady of the Lake". This term incorporates the old religion of the indigenous people from this area.<br1>
