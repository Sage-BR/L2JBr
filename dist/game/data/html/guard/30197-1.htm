Sorry, can't tell you. Strict orders not to say a word... <br1>
But what is that all about... the Ivory Tower being a well-known hideout for Mystics, eh? Those bleedin' Mystics... always up to something. Legend says that long ago, during the Elmoreden Empire, the magicians there controlled the whole continent! Imagine that! And listen to this -- the Mystics apparently resent the proper rule system we've established, and want power back in their hands!<br>
If you want to know more, you'd be best off visitin' the Ivory Tower and asking the Mystics yourself.<br>
