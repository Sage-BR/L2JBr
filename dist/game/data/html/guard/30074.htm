Greetings. I sincerely welcome you to our village. There are many dangerous areas around here, so you must be particularly careful when you travel. Be especially careful from that point past the temple in front of me, where you can see the ruins left by the <font color="LEVEL">Lesser Giants.</font> You never know when or where some monster will make a surprise attack on you.<br>
