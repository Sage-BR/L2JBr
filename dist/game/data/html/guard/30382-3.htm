When the war broke out, the people who were unable to escape to Gludio Castle all flocked to the village of Bernice. They thought they could withstand the attack of the invaders because the village had a stone outer wall. The lord's soldiers, who suffered retreat after retreat, positioned themselves using the village as a stronghold. Einhasad's priests who were healing the wounded also stayed at the village.<br>
After fighting off the Gracian army a few times, the people of the village began to hope. But it was no use -- the Gracian army had sent in mercenary Ol Mahum forces. Those degenerates broke the outer wall and pushed in, slaughtering everyone in sight, and burned down the village.<br>
Bernice turned into charred ruins overnight, and the people that were murdered still remain as spirits, filled with hate and vengeance.<br>
