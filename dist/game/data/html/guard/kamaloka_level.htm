According to research from the Ivory Tower, the established theory is that Kamaloka is from a dimensional overlapping in Aden's land. Kamaloka has stages of power based on the strength of a monster's soul. This is cutting edge science, and we don't fully understand it. So we introduce adventurers to Kamaloka that's appropriate for them.<br>
Levels of Kamaloka notified by each captain are as follows.<br>
Captain Bathis (Town of Gludio): levels 23, 26, 29<br>
