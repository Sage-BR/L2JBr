<html><body>Guard Kurt:<br>
Hello, I am Guard Kurt. I mainly assist Sir Ortho Lancer and help maintain the village's security. Sir Ortho Lancer is a fine man who used to serve in the Black Lion Troops when he was young. He is always so full of energy; sometimes it's hard to keep up with him.<br>
Sir Lancer worries that our village may be in danger because of the monsters that come out of the <font color="LEVEL">Execution Grounds</font> of Dion these days.<br>
