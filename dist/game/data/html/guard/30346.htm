<html><body>Sentry Kayleen:<br>
Greetings. Have you seen many places? My wish is to adventure in the wide, outside world someday. When I give up my job as sentry, I am thinking of traveling to Elmore. If you go there, there is the village of <font color="LEVEL">Pabell</font> built by Dark Elves.<br>
Maybe it's just because of the oppressive atmosphere that hangs around the <font color="LEVEL">School of Dark Arts</font>, but sometimes my wish seems a very remote possibility.<br>
