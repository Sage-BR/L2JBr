Dion looks like a destitute village now, but I was told that it was once a very prosperous land. Wheat harvested from the broad, sweeping plains of Dion used to provide wealth.<br>
However, the territory was taxed exorbitantly during the war because of that, and subsequent uprisings left the town one of the poorest in the whole kingdom.<br>
Something really must be done here.<br>
