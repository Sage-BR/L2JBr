Hunter's Village is set up in the Enchanted Valley just east of here. Full of all kinds of weird and wacky creatures, I hear, which is why the Village was built there in the first place; sort of a little sanctuary for the hunters to put their feet up after a hard day's killing.<br>
Course, that was then... nowadays hardly any of the townfolk are actually hunters. Instead you'll find herbalists, traders, poets and drunkards by the handful, but I'd bet a penny or two that not a one of them could tell a bird from a bear.<br>
