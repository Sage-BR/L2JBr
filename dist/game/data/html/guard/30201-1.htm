The Enchanted Valley may look nearby on the Map but is actually quite far. It is accessible from the north and south. Hunters camping to the south eventually turned their campsite into a village...<br>
It is said that Fairies hide there...Certainly you've heard the legends of Fairies? Tiny Elf-like creatures with small wings... Anyway, in the past they were hunted by Humans, and today they haunt the people living in the valley. This is one of the reasons why the valley is not a safe place for humans...<br>
If you would like to learn more about Fairies, ask at the Hunter's Village. They know all about them!<br>
