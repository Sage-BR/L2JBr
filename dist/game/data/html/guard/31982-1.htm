If you must blame someone for the situation, you should look beyond the monsters. I won't name names, but the wandering merchants are certainly part of the problem. They have no loyalty whatsoever for this village! They only think about Adena!<br>
The Dwarven and Orcish merchants are the worst! Rivalries between the two races are threatening to boil over at any moment! This is bound to end horribly!<br>
