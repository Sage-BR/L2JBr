Do you know much about a temple in Gludio Castle? It's where the Lord of Gludio resides.<br>
The site was originally an ancient ruin of the Age of Lesser Giants, but wise King Cadmus commanded a castle be built on the site to prepare for Gracian incursions.<br>
And when Gracia actually invaded our kingdom a few years ago, the garrison in Gludio used the castle as a base and fought tenaciously to thwart the enemy invasion. It's all thanks to the keen insight of His Majesty.<br>
