May the peace of the lake rest upon you. My name is Berry, one of the Sentinels who guard the forest and the Mother Tree Glade.<br>
When I was young like you, I had opportunities to travel to many places around the continent. I have seen many places, but none are as beautiful as our Elven village.<br>
