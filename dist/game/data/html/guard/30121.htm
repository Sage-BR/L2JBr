<html><body>Captain Jeronin:<br>
Welcome, traveler. I am Captain Jeronin, and I train guards and keep order in town in the service of Sir Ortho Lancer. Ours is a commercial town, so we have many people who come and go. And because of that, we invest a lot of effort into keeping order and peace around here.<br>
