You must be new in these parts!<br>
Those Golems were created by the infamous mad scientist Dwarf, Dr. Chaos himself! He used the Star Stones found in this area to create some truly terrifying Golems, and used them to seize control of the entire Pavel area!<br>
They truly live up to their horrifying title! Personally, I've never seen them, but just imagine how scary they must be!<br>
