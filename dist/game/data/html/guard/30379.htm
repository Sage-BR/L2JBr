<html><body>Captain Bezique:<br>
Welcome to Gludin! My name is Bezique, and I'm the Guard Captain around here. Our townspeople have been trying to come up with a plan to defend our home from Sakum!<br>
Southern Gracia has also showed their interest in our project, and started trading with us. I don't suppose you can help too?<br>
