<html><body>Defender Cromwell:<br>
Hark, who approaches the Dwarven Village? I'm Cromwell, in charge of guarding this entrance... You say you've heard of me, eh? Not bloody likely, stranger! You must have me confused with someone else.<br>
Have you heard about the beach north of here? It's a great place to go and relax. I sometimes go there on my day off. You'd probably like it there.<br>
