<html><body>Captain Raigen:<br>
Welcome, stranger, I am Captain Raigen. Hunter's Village was first formed by hunters who attempted to catch unique monsters in the Enchanted Valley and Forest of Mirrors. The Lord of Aden respects the town's unique makeup and acknowledges, to some extent, its autonomy.<br>
However, since mostly ruthless criminals gather here, feuds are never ending. Even though we can turn a blind eye to many happenings, if a rumored outlaw guild exists, we will be penalized. I've only heard rumors, we have never actually found these outlaws... But if you find anyone suspicious, please report it to us immediately.<br>
