Welcome to Hunter's Village! Normally ruffians gather here, but recently I've been seeing more and more normal people like you around. I will ask you a favor though... please don't stir up any commotions.<br>
To the south of the Hunter's Village is <font color="LEVEL">Dragon Valley,</font> and over by Castle Giran, <font color="LEVEL">the Town of Giran</font> is situated.<br>

<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Chat 2">"Tell me about the Town of Giran."</Button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_TerritoryStatus">"Can you tell me about the local lord and tax rate?"</Button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="QUEST" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Quest">Quest</Button>
