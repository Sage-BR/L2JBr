Wow, really? You really have no idea!<br>
(Low whisper)<br>
This is the Pagan Temple. It might look like a regular temple, but it's actually really dangerous! And if you don't have either a <font color="LEVEL">Visitor's Badge</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Pagan's Badge</font>, you'll be zombie meat for the Gatekeeper Zombies over there!  <br>
So you'd better return to the village fast. Geez, good thing I was here...whew.
