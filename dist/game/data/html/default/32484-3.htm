The Delusion Chamber is a dream maze we discovered not long ago. Just like Rim Kamaloka, it is presumed to be a manifestation of the darkness invading our world.<br>
It exists in the empty space between dream worlds. In terms of shape and structure, we presume it is related to the <font color="LEVEL">Dimensional Rift</font>, but we know little for now...<br>
However, we do know that there are rewards for defeating the enemies who inhabit this place. If you have the courage, perhaps you would be interested in challenging the Delusion Chamber?<br>
