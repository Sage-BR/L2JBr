The <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity</font> is a demonic domain ruled by <font color="LEVEL">Ekimus</font>, minion of Shilen and Lord of the Undead.<br>
The info we have gained at the cost of many lives is this: <font color="LEVEL">this area functions like a  living organism</font>. Just as the whole body weakens with illness, the entire place weakens in power if we take down its monsters.<br>
Conversely, if people like you die in here, you will help feed the Seed and its power.<br>
This is why <font color="LEVEL">only command channels of the most powerful warriors may enter</font>.<br>
