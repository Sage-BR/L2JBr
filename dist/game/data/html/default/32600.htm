Phew! It's so chaotic here! Oh Hello! Hello!<br>
I am Alegria, here to celebrate your birthday! Heeheehee!<br>
Did you get my present? I hurried and flew here just in case you wanted to exchange your Birthday Hat for the Explorer Hat (event) you'd received before. I will exchange the <font color="LEVEL">Explorer Hat (event) with the Birthday Hat</font> for you, if you like, and there's no charge!<br>
