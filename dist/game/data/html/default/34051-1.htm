Grandpa Shadai? <br>
After Faeron Village came to the Material Realm, I started wandering around. I was worried at first, but our story spread throughout the continent, so it wasn't that dangerous.<br>
I met Grandpa Toma as I wandered through the continent. He told me how he was also the wandering type, and that he traveled a lot when he was young. He was the one who introduced me to Grandpa Shadai.<br>
Grandpa Shadai said that it would be better for me to learn a skill for when I decided to settle down, and taught me his skills.<br>
