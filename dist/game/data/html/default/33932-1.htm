<html><body>High Priest Gereth:<br>
Sayha's tower is the closest place where you can speak to Sayha. Just speak to him there, and Sayha will always listen.<br>
Back when we were in the Wind Spirit Realm, we'd seek Sayha's counsel any time something big happened in Faeron.<br>
Thank goodness the tower wasn't damaged when it Faeron Village entered the Material Realm. Of course, we became worried once we could no longer hear Sayha's voice, but our belief that he is still with us is unchanged.<br>
