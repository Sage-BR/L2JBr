Will you look at this magnificent place? The beauty of the buildings and the statues tempts me. I just want to write a poem and sing about this place.<br>
Looking at the temple under this beautiful tree brings tears in my eyes. I have so much work to do with Minstrel Liberatto, but I can't manage to leave this place.<br><br>
