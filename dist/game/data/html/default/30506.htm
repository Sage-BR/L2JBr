O' follower of the Flame!<br>
Be welcome here! I have been dispatched here to the Town of Gludio, but I have not forgotten our pride, our honor, our glory. The same cannot be said of the wretched Turek, Enku, and Vuku tribes. They are foul and deserve to be cursed forever! Do not follow their example... stay true to your heritage!<br>
