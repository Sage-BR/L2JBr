Let me tell you about your targets... <br1>
They are called the <font color="LEVEL">Kanabion</font> , creatures constructed of pure malice and darkness.<br>
They are more than monsters -- it as though the vilest sorcery takes physical form. We must defeat them to prevent Kamaloka from continuing to spread throughout Aden.<br>
For your efforts, we can offer you varying grades of equipment, ranging from <font color="LEVEL">S-grade to D-grade</font> .<br>
We can also give you the <font color="LEVEL">Essence of Kamaloka</font> from the Kanabions you defeated. Of course, it has little value in the "real" world.<br>
If you don't want it, we'd certainly appreciate you donating it to us. In return, we will give an item of equivalent value.<br>
Remember, though, that because Rim Kamaloka is connected to your dream, if you should die there no one can help you until all the Kanabions are defeated or the time limit expires.<br>
Our technology <font color="LEVEL">only allows you to stay in Rim Kamaloka for 20 minutes at a time</font>.
