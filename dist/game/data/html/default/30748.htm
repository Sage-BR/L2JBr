Greetings, two-legged creature! What brings you up this tall mountain? If you intend to kill me with that weapon, please proceed. All my eggs are lost, I am terribly heartbroken... Where have those vicious egg thieves gone? Possibly they have crossed this mountain range and gone to the Elven Village... Or maybe to the Sea of Spores?...<br>
