Leona and Sieghardt had a showdown in Goddard.<br>
It was about slave trade. They say the lord of Goddard did it, but everyone knows that the Dawn Knights are directly involved. Iason Heine is tied up in it, and he's the Dawn Knights' cash cow, so there's no doubt.<br>
Sieghardt was just helping Iason Heine. But so what? He helped it happen, the selling of people. He is just as guilty in this filthy business!<br>
