<html><body>Magister Atraxia:<br>
I have been here for some time now, but I still have trouble with this weather. When it gets too frigid, I endure it by thinking of my balmy Elven homeland.<br>
We Elves are closely attuned to our environment; that's the essence of our magic and our strength.<br1>
 May Einhasad guide you on your path, my friend.<br1><br>
