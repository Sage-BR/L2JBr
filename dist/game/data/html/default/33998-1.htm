<html><body>Blacksmith Momet:<br>
If you need dual weapons, Momet's your blacksmith! Anything is possible, <font color="LEVEL">except for A-grade</font> weapons! I wonder if anyone's better than me. Maybe <font color="LEVEL">Mammon's own legendary blacksmith</font>?<br>
You just need to bring me your sword, a Stone of Purity, and a small fee.<br>
Dual weapons are formed by combining a <font color="LEVEL">Normal weapon</font> with another Normal weapon, a <font color="LEVEL">Basic weapon</font> with another Basic weapon, and a <font color="LEVEL">Rare weapon</font> with a Normal weapon. Rare weapons are actually B-grade or higher.<br>
And you can't combine weapons that have options on them so don't even bother bringing those.<br>
Oh, if you combine enchanted weapons, those effects will disappear so don't get mad at me about that!<br>
