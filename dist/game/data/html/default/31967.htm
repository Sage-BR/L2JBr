<html><body>Master Euline:<br>
Greetings! Are you familiar with the Elven art of war? Our movements may seem soft and graceful to the uninitiated, but there is a hidden strength to them. Consider the power of river and wind: they can erode mountains and carve canyons in the earth's floor.<br>
Our training teaches the value of patience and skill. In the face of an experienced Elven Warrior, not even the mightiest Orc can long persevere!<br>
