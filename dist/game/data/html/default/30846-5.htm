Haha! If you want to augment an item, you came to the right place. We can augment any item or remove any previous augmentation!<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> are needed to augment items, but they can <font color="LEVEL">no longer be found</font>. But don't worry! A more powerful stone has been found. It's called the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone</font>.<br>
You can <font color="LEVEL">continue augmenting</font> with the <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> that you have left, but I can also exchange them for <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font>.<br>
