<html><body>Mysterious Butler:<br>
This title has been granted with my master's authority to the clan that produced this week's winner, the greatest warrior.<br1>
This title is given to just <font color="LEVEL">one clan</font> among all the clans.<br>
It is given at the beginning of a new week to the clan that is associated with the greatest warrior. The title doesn't transfer, even if that warrior switches to another clan.<br>
It grants a special buff that gives a little bit of help to nearby clan members who belong to the greatest clan.<br>
