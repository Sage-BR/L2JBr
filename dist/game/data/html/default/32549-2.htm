<html><body>General Dilios:<br>
Currently, the Dragonkin controls the Seed of Destruction. You must go there and defeat its captain, Tiat.<br>
Attacking the Seed with any less than a command channel of 5 parties would be suicide. Meet up with Sergeant Allenos and you should be able to gain access into the Seed.<br>
Our scouts tell us that the Seed of Destruction has a defense mechanism. Once intruders are noticed it begins charging. If you cannot complete this assault within two hours the defense system will expel you from the Seed.<br>
The interior of the Seed is sealed by a powerful barrier protected by 3 devices. Once you have broken through the defenses, you will reach the <font color="LEVEL">Fortress of Destruction</font>. If you can defeat Tiat and his minions we will finally have a foothold in this wretched place!<br>
