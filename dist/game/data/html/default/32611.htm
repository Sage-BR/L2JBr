<html><body>Officer Tolonis:<br>
I am Officer Tolonis, and it's my job to deliver supplies such as Energy Stones to adventurers.<br>
I used to be a platoon leader, but I was injured in action, so they gave me this posting. It's no life for a soldier, I tell you what. Oh, well, I suppose someone has to do it.<br>
Oh, and if you're interested in acquiring the collection skill, perhaps I can help.<br>
