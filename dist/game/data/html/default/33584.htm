There's no such thing as a useless item!<br1>
Everything is useful to someone. You know, like when you find the perfect use for that odd knickknack you've had crammed in the bottom of your travel bag for ages? Hmm?<br1>
Rebuilding ruins takes all kinds of materials, you know, One's trash is another's treasure, right? Tell you what, you bring mw junk and I'll give you a Fortune Treasure Chest. Win fir you, win for me...plus a tiny transaction fee.<br>
You might have some in your inventory right now. Don't you have common materials Lv. 1-3, or some crystals?<br>
Don't like the pendant attached to your hair accessory? Well, how about sealling it? A sealed pendant can help you craft a new one. If you want to know more, go ask a Maestro!<br>
