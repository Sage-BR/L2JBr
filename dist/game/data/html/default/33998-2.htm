You want to bestow special abilities on your weapons?<br>
Don't worry about the enchant. Enhancing the weapons will not make the enchant disappear. The new abilities for the items will be shown below the information. You do know that you can only see the weapons you already have? <br>
Also A-Grade weapons and above cannot be handled by just anyone. I can't help you with that. Perhaps the legendary <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font> can do it.<br>
Also, when you want to <font color="LEVEL">remove</font> any <font color="LEVEL">special abilities</font>, the <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith of Mammon</font> can help you with that. There are rumors that the <font color="LEVEL">Black Marketeer of Mammon</font> too has learned <font color="LEVEL">how to remove special abilities</font>.<br>
Choose the capabilities you wish to add to your weapons!<br>
