Hanna introduced me to this place, and that's how I came to work here. Hanna, Lailly and I are all from the same village.<br>
Lailly used to tell me stories about her travels around the world, so I always wanted to go travel too. When Hanna asked me whether I wanted to come work here, I was really happy.<br>
I do get lonely since I'm away from home, but everyone here is very nice, and we meet new customers every day, do I don't have much time to get lonely.<br>
