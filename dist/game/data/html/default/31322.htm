You adventurers are all the same! The fact that you can swing a sword without chopping your fingers off does not make you a mighty hero! The truth is that your movements are wild and inefficient. Your tactical sense is nonexistent. You're easily distracted by anything that glitters.<br>
Study with me and I'll make a real soldier out of you! I'll make you disciplined and hard as brass! Hooyah!<br>
