Haha, has my calling you 'kiddo' annoyed you? Well, Iâ€™ve lived for hundreds of years, so everyone is a kid to me!<br>
Still, now that I think of it, you kiddos nowadays have a lot of fight in you. A good example would be Arcturus, the new Hunter Guild President.<br>
I was thinking of leaving the Hunter Guild, but I have decided to stay a while longer to partake in the dreams of Arcturus. I'm in charge of selling requests issued by Arcturus. Aria Furstmater has asked me to take over her job because she's leaving soon. Tell me if you're interested in any of these items.<br>
