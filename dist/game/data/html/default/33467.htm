<html><body>Mysterious Dye Merchant Meraldi:<br>
Dye, dye, dye! Get your dye here!<br>
You there! Yes you, standing there all suave and gallant looking. Are you in the need of some good dyes for symbols? There's always a need for quality dye, don't you think? If you want dye, step right up! Step right up, make a wager here! You pay a set fee and cross your fingers! I spin this little bottle and depending on where it stops, I give you <font color="LEVEL">a random dye!</font><br>
You could be lucky and get a very rare and fabulous dye... or, you may just end up with something blah and ordinary. But you won't know until you try, now will you?<br>
Hurry, hurry! Step right up! Try for dye!<br>
