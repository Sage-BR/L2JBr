<html><body>Rafforty:<br>You can combine each soul with the accessories of Freya, Queen Ant, Orfen, Antharas, and Valakas to create an item of even greater power! But--there's always a but--if you want me to combine these, the item that you possess will disappear, poof! And you'll receive a new item in return. And, if it's already enchanted, the existing enchant value will also disappear.<br1>
Also, the Ring of the Beginning can be exchanged for a more powerful item. Also, the accessories of Helios, Ramona, Core, or Harnak can be condensed into the Source of the Emperor, which can be used to enhance the Ring of the Beginning.<br>
And, <font color="LEVEL">if it's already enchanted, the existing enchant value will also disappear.</font><br>
If you still want to proceed, I'm happy to bestow the souls and give you a more powerful item in exchange.<br>
