<html><body>Employee Lupia:<br>
I'm actually from the Wind Spirit Realm. The dimensional rift brought a lot of us to the Material Realm.<br>
When I woke up, all my friends were gone, and I saw things I'd never seen before. I was so surprised. I fell near Windy Hill. I was wandering around, without knowing what to do, and that's when I ran into Lollia.<br>
Lollia said I we can all be a family here, and thanks to her, I met Mei, Brodien, and Hanna. Another of my friends also came over to the Material Realm, so we are working together now.<br>
