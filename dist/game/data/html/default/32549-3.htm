<html><body>General Dilios:<br>
The Seed of Infinity is more dangerous than ever before. Previous plans won't work -- we are thinking of entering with a command channel comprised of 5 parties.<br>
Once we enter, we'll need to go into the Hall of Suffering, guarded by the cursed Yehan twins. Once you defeat these knights, you'll enter the Heart of Infinity, where Ekimus awaits.<br>
Once we take down Ekimus, Gracia will regain a measure of peace, at least for a while.<br>
