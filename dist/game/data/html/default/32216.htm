Welcome to the Kamael Guild! <br1>
 Perhaps you've heard of the need for mercenaries to defend Giran's trade and protect its Merchant Guild Association? It is a booming business!<br>
These mercenaries are highly regarded, but let me assure you that they are rank amateurs compared to our Kamael Warriors. Let us face them in battle and their reputation will sink faster than a pond-tossed stone!<br>
