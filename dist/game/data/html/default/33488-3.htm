The Giant's used a form of transportation called <font color="LEVEL">Sayune</font>. It allowed them to travel great distances by leaping from one point to another at an incredible speed.<br>
Once you have Awakened, you should now have the power to use Sayune.<br>
In fact, there is a spot behind me that allows you to use Sayune. Stand on it and there should be an icon that you can press. This Sayune location is linked to the one in Talking Island Village.
