<html><body>Magmeld Delegation Leader Lada:<br>
Magmeld was discovered long ago by Elven Elemental Masters.<br>
It is a beautiful place filled with the amiable Cat people and Trees of Genesis.<br>
But you need to be careful -- beautiful places can still be fraught with danger! Apparently, Magmeld has a dark secret deep within its depths.<br>
Which is why they really need help over there! Do you want to go and see for yourself?<br>
