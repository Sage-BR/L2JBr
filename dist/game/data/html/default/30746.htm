May the song of the west wind guide you to tranquility. I am pleased to meet you. My name is Cybellin. I am a Dark Elven Mystic studying abyssal magic.<br>
I have come to the Hunter's Village to collect the rare Spirit Ore that was found in Enchanted Valley. I am also involved in the study of Blood Crystals.<br>
