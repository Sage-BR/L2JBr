The local monsters have all been brainwashed by Beleth. We're looking for a way to save them, but all we can do right now is to take the Demonic Tomes out of their hands.<br>
So bring either the <font color="LEVEL">Sealed Demonic Tome</font> or the <font color="LEVEL">Bloodied Demonic Tome</font>, and I'll pay ya for it.<br>
