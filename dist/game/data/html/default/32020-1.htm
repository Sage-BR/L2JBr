You can combine each soul with the accessories of Freya, Queen Ant, Orfen, Antharas, and Valakas to create an item of even greater power! But--there's always a but--if you want me to combine these, the item that you possess will disappear, poof! And you'll receive a new item in return. And, <font color="LEVEL">if it's already enchanted, the existing enchant value will also disappear.</font><br>
If you still want to proceed, I'm happy to bestow the souls and give you a more powerful item in exchange.<br>
