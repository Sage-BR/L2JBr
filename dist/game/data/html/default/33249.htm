Heh. Are you looking at my hat? It's awesome, right?<br>
My dad gave it to me when I left my home in the dwarven town. Make sure we don't lose you in a crowd, he said! Hahaha, no fear of that.<br>
Ahh, my dad's a good 'un. He should have come with me... it's not the same back home since the rain of blood. Always used to be full of snow, but now it's hardly the same place!
