What is it?! Do you have something to tell me about Sakum?<br>
Through the good offices of the Adventure Guild, I have become able to concentrate fully on collecting information relating to Sakum.<br>
If you need help from an Adventure Guildsman, do not come to me. Look for a different Adventure Guildsman at the center of the village.<br>
If you're here to talk about Sakum, though, you've found the right person.<br>
