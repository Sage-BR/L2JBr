<html><body>Hierarch Asterios:<br>
May the blessing of Eva comfort and strengthen your soul.<br>
Welcome. I am one of Eva's chosen. The sole surviving hierarch or the 12 hierarchs chosen chosen by the Mother Tree. My name is Hierarch Asterios and the last king of the Kingdom of Forest Balderan has charged me to watch over the Elves of Light, the forests, and the fairies. I've come to the Ancient City Arcan to find out how to stop the plague and save Mother Tree. But enough about me, what is that I can do for you?<br>
