When the world was first created, it was a wonderful, safe place. Nothing evil or dangerous existed. There was a perfect balance of creation, light, and chaos. But, the incompetence and infighting of the Gods spawned evil and darkness. Rather than dealing with it, the gods just let it fester... and fester... until they lost control of the darkness and the balance was lost.<br>
Our only hope is to find a way to <font color="LEVEL">resurrect the Giants</font>. Only they can face the gods and save the world from the darkness. They will conquer the dark and bring light and meaning back to this world!
