<html><body>Mysterious Butler:<br>
I heard many have been curious about the Mysterious Mansion since it appeared. This is also your reason for talking to me, I assume?<br>
I cannot tell you everything, but I will give you one piece of information. Did you know that the Ceremony of Chaos is being sponsored by the Mysterious Mansion?<br>
My master enjoys meeting great warriors, and sometimes gives gifts to those he likes. But not everyone gets to meet him - only those who prove themselves worthy can meet my master.<br>
This is where warriors come to prove their worth and their clans' honor, hoping to meet my master one day. Also, my master will bestow his authority upon the clan that fosters the greatest warrior.<br>
Oh, and you know that you need both luck and strength to be the best, right? Well, you'll see for yourself soon enough, I suppose.<br>
I Hope to greet you as an honored guest here.<br>
