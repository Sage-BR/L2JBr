Tejakar Oroka! Hooray to the glory of the great Orcs! I am the Chieftain Takuna, leading the Duda-Mara tribe! I've been sent to this land by order of the Flame Lord to find the tribes who betrayed us, seceding from the kingdom of Orcs long ago, and give them the ruthless punishment they deserve!<br>
