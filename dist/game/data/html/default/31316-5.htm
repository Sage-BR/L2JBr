Lately, customers have become very interested in item augmenting. I have a lot of experience with the process, so you don't have to worry about the product's quality.<br>
You need <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> to augment, but Life Stones can no longer be found. However, a new more powerful type of stone was found. It's called the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone</font>.<br>
Of course, you can continue <font color="LEVEL">augmenting</font> with the <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> that you have left. I can also exchange them for <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font> if you want.<br>
