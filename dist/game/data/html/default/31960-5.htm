OK, you can augment an item here.<br>
Did you hear that Life Stones can no longer be found? The good thing is that a more powerful stone has been found. It's called the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone</font>.<br>
If you have some Life Stones left, you can still augment items. I can also exchange those Life Stones for <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font>.<br>
