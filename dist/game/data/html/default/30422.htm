<html><body>Abyssal Celebrant Kalinta:<br>
Our god has abandoned us. When our god was here, we never feared dying. But now, without our god, without knowing the future of our race, we, the Dark Elves, will not willingly let our race die!<br>
Our god has disappeared, but darkness and loneliness... they are always with us! We wrap them around ourselves for comfort and we survive....<br>
