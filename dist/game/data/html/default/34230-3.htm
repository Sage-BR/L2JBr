Various materials are needed in order to create a Blackbird Clan Talisman. However, the most important thing is what is known as the Demon Crystal.<br>
The most common way of obtaining this Demon Crystal is from the supply boxes that you will receive after helping us with our missions. Just add some additional materials and pay a nominal sum, and finally you will be the proud owner of a Blackbird Clan Talisman!<br>
Said again, this is an item reserved for those who have helped us most enthusiastically. Hahaha!<br>
