<html><body>Collector Marsha:<br>
Merciful heavens, you startled me! How did you sneak up on me like that?!<br>
Anyway, it's nice to meet you! I am Collector Marsha, an expert in exotic substances. I am here searching for Star Stones. I had no idea this place was so dangerous! Earlier I was nearly killed, and now I fear for my older brother!<br>
