<html><body>Evacuated Fairy Hierarch Noeti Mimilead:<br>
Hello, adventurer who came from far from here. My name is Noeti Mimilead. I'm ashamed and don't know what to tell you because I look horrible, but I have fled from Kimerian a few days ago.<br>
I don't know when, but suddenly Kimerian has changed. He is now a powerful tyrant and is changing people who don't obey him into horrific shapes. Go to the Fairy village outside the town, you will see the Fairy citizens that are changed into monsters by Kimerian.<br>
