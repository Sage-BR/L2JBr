I am sorrowed to see such discord here in this Tower. If we all pursue the same truth, how can we so easily turn on each other?

One hopeful sign is the news that Elves and Humans are working together to clean up the Sea of Spores. Perhaps that will provide the foundation upon which we can build a lasting peace...<br>
