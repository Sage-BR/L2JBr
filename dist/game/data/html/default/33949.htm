Nice to meet you, Adventurer.<br1>
I'm an Auction House Manager from Aden Kingdom. You want to know about the Auction House?<br>
Simply put, you can come here to buy any registered item tht can be found throughout the continent.<br1>
Of course, if there's anything you want to sell, you can register that item here as well.<br>
Just pay a small commission when registering an item.<br1>
Additionally, <font color="LEVEL">a commission will be automatically deducted whenever a transaction takes place</font>.<br>
So, how about it? Would you like to try it out?<br>
