Ah, welcome! I've been so absent-minded lately that I didn't even notice you there. If you look around Giran, you'll understand why. It's like this all day long: noise and crowds and chaos!<br>
It is very different from my own orderly homeland. Ah, you came for training? Good. I need something to keep focused!<br>
