Have you heard of the <font color=LEVEL>Orc Supervia</font>?<br>
When our orc kingdom collapsed, they fought against the <font color=LEVEL>Noble Orcs</font>. Currently, they don't belong to the orc coalition, and work independently.<br>
Their anti-orc behavior is troubling.<br>
Worse, they have unified various other tribes into their anti-<font color=LEVEL>Noble Orc</font> agenda. They're now more powerful than any other individual tribe.<br>
I'm certain they're plotting something.
