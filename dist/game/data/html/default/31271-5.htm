Do you have a request for Hilda? I can augment an item or remove augmentation.<br>
By the way, do you have Life Stones? I heard that <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones can no longer be found</font>. The good thing is that a more powerful stone has been found. It's called the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone</font>.<br>
I'm busy, but if you have some <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> left, I can still augment items for you. If not, I can exchange them for <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font>.<br>
