<html><body>Musician Barbado:<br>
Welcome, you fresh-faced traveler! I am a musician, an artisan of melodies. Music is the finest blessing bestowed upon us by Eva, the goddess of art. When you're feeling blue, as I sometimes do, nothing cheers you up like a cheerful tune played on the accordion! It will lighten the darkest mood!<br>
