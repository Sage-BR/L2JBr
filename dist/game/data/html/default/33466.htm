Hey adventurer!<br>
You looking for some top quality dyes for those symbols? Hmm? I've got just the stuff you're looking for, right here... There is one catch though... <font color="LEVEL">When you buy from me, you get a random dye</font>! Why? Well, why not? It's way more fun that way!<br>
No picking and choosing. If you're lucky, you'll get an incredible deal on a very rare dye. If you're not so lucky, you'll get an average deal on an ordinary dye. Willing to risk it?<br>
What do you think? Would you like to try?<br>
