I'm Jamon, the sole Aracna Researcher.<br>
there has been no progress in research on the Aracna since they're almost extinct. There are only three Aracna survivors and their existence is critical, but their relationship is rather complicated.<br>
I'm currently researching Orfen, one of the Aracna survivors. I came here because I'm worried that things have been stirring after she has stayed quiet for so long.<br>
