The reason why I ended up here?<br>
I believe it's Eva's blessing. I truly believe so. I've been wandering here and there, and I met Settlen in the hot springs.<br>
We talked about life, and where it's leading us, and here I am now.<br>
I'm very happy to meet new adventurers every day. I don't miss my wandering life at all.
