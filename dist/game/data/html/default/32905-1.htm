We're the Mews of the Cat tribe. We were the first to extend the Cat's reach by opening up trade with the Elves. We exchange a lot of items, and a lot of culture through those routes.<br>
The Mews also led the peacekeeping talks among the different tribes. And, among the Cats, we have the most elite culture and the strongest magical power. Oh, and we're way prettier and sleeker than the Wauls and the Purrs! Aren't we positively beautiful?<br>
