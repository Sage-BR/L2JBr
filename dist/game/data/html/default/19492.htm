<html><body>Masa:<br>
Slaves sold to Hellbound became subjects to Beleth's experiments.<br>
 You see, when a number of them die, the color of the magic circle changes. When it's yellow, the slaves have a chance of being rescued.<br>
 But some slaves may be mutated beyond sanity, so be careful of their attacks!<br>
 When the magic circle is in full power, it's red. It produces berserk monsters, but hard as they are to beat, they give some really good rewards!
