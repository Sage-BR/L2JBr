You can augment an item or remove augmentation here. Choose what you'd like.<br>
Did you hear that Life Stones can no longer be found? The good thing is that a more powerful stone has been found. It's called the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone</font>.<br>
If you have some <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> left, you can still <font color="LEVEL">augment items</font>. I can also exchange those Life Stones for <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font>. <br>
