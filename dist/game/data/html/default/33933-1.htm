<font color="LEVEL">Serevan</font> is the last name given to me by the Queen.<br>
On the day we arrived in the Material Realm, monsters attacked us while we were overwhelmed. Queen Navari fought hard, but was attacked by Makkum while she was weary from trying to speak to Sayha. That's when I helped and became the so-called hero of the village...heh.<br>
If it hadn't been for him that day, I can't even bear to think... <br>
