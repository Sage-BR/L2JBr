Gracia is interesting, yes, interesting for its seeds. Many seeds, very interesting!<br>
We have found, let me see... Talisman - Infinity, Talisman - Destruction, Talisman - Annihilation, Talisman - Hellfire, Talisman - Desire, Talisman - Longing, and Talisman - Insanity! But I can only offer the Talisman - Infinity. But no worries! With the <font color="LEVEL">Energy of Destruction</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Energy</font>, you can create a Seed Talisman beyond that of Destruction! It does not always work, of course, but it is worth trying, yes! Oh, and when you're upgrading them, use <font color="LEVEL">Kaliel's Energy</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Elcyum</font> to increase the success rate.<br>
Oh, and wearing multiple will not give you multiple effects!<br>
Ah! I want you to know that I cannot help you create Talisman - Insanity. But if you use <font color="LEVEL">combination</font> in the inventory, you will be able to get one. But the chances are low because it is so rare.<br>
All Seed Talismans are bound to you, but you can unbind the Talisman - Longing and Talisman - Insanity by sealing them.<br>
