<html><body>Seed Talisman Manager:<br>
Gracia is interesting, yes, interesting for its seeds. Many seeds, very interesting!<br>
We have found, let me see... Talisman - Infinity, Talisman - Destruction, Talisman - Annihilation, Talisman - Hellfire, Talisman - Desire, Talisman - Longing, and Talisman - Insanity! But I can only offer you the Talisman - Infinity.<br>
But no worries! With <font color="LEVEL">Energy of Destruction</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Giant's Energy</font>, you can create a Seed Talisman beyond that of Destruction! It does not always work, of course, but it is worth trying, yes! Oh, and wearing multiple will not give you multiple effects! All Talismans are bound to you, but you can unbind the Talisman - Longing and Talisman - Insanity by sealing it.<br>
