<html><body>Fisher Peeves:<br>
Oh, nice to meet you! I'm Peeves, a fisher.<br>
When I was young, my parents didn't want me to fish since it's dangerous... But how could I stop doing something so fun?<br>
Are you interested in fishing? Have you heard of the <font color="LEVEL">Heine Exclusive Bait</font>?<br>
If you have a <font color="LEVEL">Heine Exclusive Bait Coupon</font>, I can exchange it for <font color="LEVEL">Heine Exclusive Bait</font>.<br>
Oh yeah, I also got a special fishing rod. Bring me some <font color="LEVEL">Heine Fishing Coins</font> and I'll give you a <font color="LEVEL">Fancy Fishing Rod</font>.<br>
You can get them from the <font color="LEVEL">Exclusive Reward Chest</font> that you can get when you fish with <font color="LEVEL">Heine Exclusive Bait</font>.<br>
