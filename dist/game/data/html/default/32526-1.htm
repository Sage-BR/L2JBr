Do you need a rundown? The Seed of Destruction is a gigantic fortress, protected by Dragonkin, shield devices, and heavy doors.<br>
There is no way to sneak in -- you must plow your way through, until you reach Tiat's throne.<br>
Speed is of the essense. Stall too long, and Dragonkin all over the fortress will come running at you. <font color="LEVEL">Plan for the swiftest route</font>.
