Hello, adventurer. Welcome to the Land of Chaos. You must be really brave. This place is in disastrous disarray.<br>
The blood strewn here is not just the monsters' blood. Refugees fled their villages because of Shilen's resurrection and the resulting disasters. They died in the exodus.<br>
The refugees' dead bodies melded with nearby monsters and became something even more grotesque. I'd like to help them somehow.<br>
