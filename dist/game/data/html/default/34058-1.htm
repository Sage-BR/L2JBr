<html><body>Aden Vanguard Captain Adoplh:<br>
Shh! Why do you think the Aden Vanguard is here? It means that this is a very dangerous place.<br>
This is the DarK Elves' territory. But something happened to the terrain, so we were dispatched to find out what happened. When we got here, we found out that the Embryo had built a giant fortress.<br>
That's why we acquired a couple strongholds inside the Atelia Fortress, and now we are trying to find out what they are up to. The other members are inside the fortress.<br>
