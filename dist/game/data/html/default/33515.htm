Hush! I'm on a mission.<br>
The Kingdom's Royal Guards are investigating a report that a ritual is being held on the Altar of Shilen, which has been closed since Melisa and Isadora disappeared. I'd like to ask you to leave us, if you don't mind.<br>
Or, if you want to go to the Altar of Shilen to stop the ritual, I can send you there. Just tell me.<br>
