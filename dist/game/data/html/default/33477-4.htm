Hmm, it sounds like you are asking about Sayune. When the war between the gods and Giants began the Giants needed a way to move swiftly. Sayune, the daughter of Sayha and a Giant, infused her powers into the ground in places. This allowed others to jump to different locations in the same manner she did.<br>
