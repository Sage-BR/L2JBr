<html><body>Bush That Wisp Likes:<br>
At first glance, this looks like an ordinary shrub. However, on closer inspection it seems that the <font color="LEVEL">Wisp</font> likes it.<br>
Perhaps it is from <font color="LEVEL">another dimension</font>.<br>
Maybe if you had <font color="LEVEL">something from where you found the wisp</font>, you could call more wisps?
