Elves and Humans have long been allowed to marry here in Innadril. That wasn't the case in the Elven Forest - in fact, I remember hearing about one Elf who was imprisoned for nearly a century just for displaying affection toward a Human!<br1>
The Elders are deeply opposed to the idea of marriage between Elves and other races... I understand your point, though: love isn't rational. The heart wants what it wants...<br>
Well, well... I don't know why I've become so sentimental. It's not like I'm a youngster anymore. In any case, what have you come here to learn?<br>
