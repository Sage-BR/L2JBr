Amadeo Cadmus may be young, but has really taken the bull by the horns over here. He personally ordered the excavation of the ruins, and is supposedly quite charming in the flesh. He has looks and power... Long blond hair... A beautiful, unblemished face... I sometimes wonder if he's an Elf, you know!<br>
Compare to the royal line in Elmore - you know I heard King Astair looks like a bear! Thank god I'm a citizen of Aden!<br>
