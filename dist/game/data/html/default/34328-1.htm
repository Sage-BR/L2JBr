<html><body>Item Broker:<br>
We will sell the items, many of them precious or hard-to-find, only at the time of the auction, which will be announced in advance.<br>
Once items are registered, they will auctioned off to the highest bidder.<br>
All non-winning bidders will be refunded the exact amount of their initial bid. The highest bidder will receive the item (at the cost specified).<br>
If you are outbid, you can return to the Item Broker and receive your refunded bid price.<br>
After the auction ends, the highest bidder can obtain his or her new items at the warehouse.<br>
If you are outbid, you must pick-up your refund within one week or the amount will be forfeited to the Item Broker. A long-term deposit is impossible due to the large number of customers.<br>
Remember: items are non-returnable, so make your selections carefully!<br>
