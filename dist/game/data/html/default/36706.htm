Welcome. My name is Mermoden. I'm performing research on different dimensions.<br>
Thanks to my research, I can now teleport as many people as I want. But this is only temporary and I don't know how long I can do this. Also, I can also teleport characters of <font color="LEVEL">Lv. 99</font> and during a dimensional siege only. But clan leaders can teleport any time they want. If you are interested, teleport now and apply for a dimensional siege.<br>
