Vortex:<br>
Vortex of confusion... One piece... Mysterious power...<br>
Aerial Cleft... This place is a battlefield where one can enter through a small vortex hall, which releases mysterious energy. When you register, you can choose between red and blue teams. When a number of members for each team is over 9, the battle field automatically becomes active.<br>
You must be able to transform into a <font color="00FFFF">Flying Transformed Object</font> to move onto the battlefield. Members of each team acquire points by attacking the other team's PCs or destroying a compressor located on the battlefield. If energy is focused on one member, they become a concentrated attack target (CAT). When you drop that target, you can gain bonus points.<br>
The winning team obtains emery pieces and star stones. Combine them with seed energy and you can change them into powerful attribute crystals using a created converter.
