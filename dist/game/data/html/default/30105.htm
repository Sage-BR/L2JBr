Welcome, youngster! Eh? You want me to train you? How can you claim to be a warrior -- just look at you! Soft hands, not a nick or scar on your face! Why, you have both of your ears! Hmph!<br>
Here, look at my hands. These are real warrior's hands: hard and calloused from swinging a sword. You, my friend, have a long and painful path ahead of you! Well, well...no time like the present to get started! Eh?<br>
