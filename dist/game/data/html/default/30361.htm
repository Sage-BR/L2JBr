Umm...hello. I... I'm Rizraell.<br>
My therapist tells me I need to get out and talk to people more, so I'm trying. She tells me to think positive. Think positive. Sounds simple, but it's SO hard! I lost my brother to the plague, my axe fell down the well, and my barn burnt down last week! What's so positive about that?!<br>
Blasted plague! Blasted fire! Blasted blasts! Argh! ... Oh, wait. Positive. Think positive. The people of Aden are nice. I should meet more of them... Hello. Have we met?
