<html><body>Seeker Captain Sporcha:<br>
All of us of the Blackbird Clan have been inspired by the grand vision of Leona Blackbird. In order to realize the peaceful world the Leona Blackbird dreams of, we are prepared to give even our lives! <br>
Here, in Hellbound, we are investigating ongoing cases in the vicinity, such as the slave trade, and are engaged primarily in rescuing the captive slaves and commandos. The ultimate goal of our activities in Hellbound, it may be said, is to thwart the live subject experimentation and conspiracy of Beleth!. Is that enough information for you?<br>
