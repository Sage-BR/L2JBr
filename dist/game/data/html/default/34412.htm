<html><body>Nerupa:<br>
What brings you here? I'm Nerupa, the last intelligent being of the Aracna.<br>
The bridge behind me was destroyed by the Mother Tree, which went berserk after Lithra was awakened. I cannot leave as I am spending all my energy to prevent further collapse.<br>
If you plan to go down to the <font color="LEVEL">Shadow of the Mother Tree</font>, use the <font color="LEVEL">bridge next to Gatekeeper Mintia</font>.<br>
