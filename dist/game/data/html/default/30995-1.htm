In a monster race eight monsters race at the same time. If you guess which monster is expected to finish first and buy that monster's race ticket, based upon the odds to win you will receive an appropriate amount of Adena.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">How the Race Works</font>Monster races run every 20 minutes in real time.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">How to Participate</font><br>
You can purchase a monster race ticket through a race manager NPC. Only between 18 minutes before the start of a race until 3 minutes before the race begins can you buy a ticket for the applicable race. When you purchase a ticket through a race manager, you can find out the names of the participating monsters and their current statistics. Three minutes before a race starts, the race manager will stop ticket sales and announce the monsters' individual odds for the current race.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">Betting</font><br>
There are two types of race betting. The Win bet means that you back a particular monster to win 1st place. The Place bet means that you will have to guess the 1st and 2nd place monsters, regardless of who finishes first or second.<br>
<font color="00FFFF">Win</font><br1>
 * Among the entire betting amount for Win betting, after subtracting the race track's own share of profit, the amount left will be your total winnings. Three minutes before the race, each monster's expected odds are announced. Each Win ticket's dividend amount is calculated by multiplying the odds by the price of a ticket. The odds are never less than 1.<br1>
 * The prize money does not get transferred to the next race.<br>
<font color="00FFFF">Place</font><br1>
 * Place betting is a way of betting when you correctly guess the two monsters who will finish first and second regardless of their order. The method of calculating the dividend amount is the same as Win betting.<br1>
 * Currently place betting is not available.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">End of Race</font><br>
When a race is over, the race manager will shout the results of the race. You can trade your ticket for Adena by speaking to a race manager NPC. Check the Winning Information Data to find out the types of bets and total winnings for the race you bet on, as well as your win status and prize amount. If you won, you can receive your prize money thorough a race manager NPC. If you did not win, a race manager will buy back your ticket for a small amount of money.<br>
If a server goes down while tickets are being sold, or while a race is in progress, the race will be cancelled. You can receive a full refund for your ticket for a cancelled race through a race manager.<br>
