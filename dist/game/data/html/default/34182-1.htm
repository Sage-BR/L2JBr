You want know about the tavern?<br>
The Mystic Tavern is our family's dream come true. We started it in order to have a place where travelers from all around the world can come to listen to the great stories that everyone has. I was worried, since Underground Gainak is not widely known, but my dad's friends spread the word for us.<br>
Currently, we only have stories about <font color="LEVEL">Kelbim, Tauti, and Freya</font>, but we will try expand later on.<br>
