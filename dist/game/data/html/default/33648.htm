Excuse me! I'm in the middle of something very important right now. How would you like it if I tried to start some chit-chat while you were in the middle of a fight? That would be pretty annoying, no? So unless you have something vitally important, I must ask that you go and bother someone else because, as I have already mentioned, I am doing important... stuff!<br>
