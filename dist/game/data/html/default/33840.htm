Hey, my friend. What are you doing here?<br>
I can't guarantee your safety if you venture too far.<br>
Of course, you will always be safe with the Noble Orcs and me, Flame Patrol Warrior Bruener. The Noble Orcs are protected by Pa'agrio, and I am a warrior selected by Pa'agrio Lord Kakai.<br>
Hahahahahaha!<br>
