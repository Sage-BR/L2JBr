<html><body>Mysterious Butler:<br>
Invitations will go out every day from 20:00 to 24:00 at 15-minute intervals. You can request to participate in the Ceremony of Chaos through this invitation.<br>
Only the chosen will stand on the battleground for the greatest of warriors.<br>
Up to 18 warriors can battle in one location. If you are lucky, you will be the only one left standing and become the winner. If you're lucky, that is.<br>
Anyway, the battle ends when there is only one left standing. We will take steps to ensure that you are unaware of each other's identities. If there are multiple challengers remaining after 5 minutes, the one with the highest number of kills will be the winner. Remember, everyone is an enemy here!<br>
When the winner is determined, 1 - 5 mysterious boxes will apprear at random. You can receive the rewards of victory through these boxes, as well as Mysterious Marks. Bring them to me and I will exchange them for reward items.<br>
Each cycle lasts a month, and for each cycle, the one with the most Mysterious Marks will earn the title of the greatest warrior. If the highest number of Mysterious Marks is equal, there will be no winner for that cycle.<br>
Also, the clan that fostered the greatest warrior shall earn the title of the greatest clan. You can exchange your Mysterious Marks for reward items without affecting the total score.<br>
