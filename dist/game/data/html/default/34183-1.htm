<html><body>Kitchen Employee Hanna:<br>
My cooking skills? Nothing to worry about there.<br>
I was known as the best chef in the village when I was 15. Everyone lined up to just have a taste of my food.<br>
Lailly is my childhood friend, but she left to travel around the world. I was so sad back then.<br>
Anyway, she missed my food all those years. So taht should tell you about how great my food really is. She came to find me once they decided to open this Mystic Tavern. That's how I ended up here.<br>
