<html><body>Goddard Vanguard Sirik:<br>
Oh you heard that. Yes, I am Sirik Ken Abygail. My father is Duke Mora Ken Abygail, the lord of Goddard. He is a noble knight and powerful warrior. However, I do not seem to have his courage. I joined the Vanguard in hopes that it would help me in finding my courage, but... well, no luck yet.<br>
