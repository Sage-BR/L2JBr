Thank you for helping Hermuncus.<br>
His spirit is free, but we need to find the remnants of his body... only then will we be able to resurrect him. I have waited for you here in the <font color="LEVEL">Reliquary of the Giants</font>, as Hermuncus commanded me. Ask me anything, and I will answer.<br>
