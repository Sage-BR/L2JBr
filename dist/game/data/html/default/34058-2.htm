We are not sure either, so we are relying on the Blackbird Clan for information. Now we are trying to go into the <font color="LEVEL">Command Post</font> to gather more information.<br>
The Command Post is the facility where the Embryo are training their new recruits. It's very hard to go inside, though, so we are getting help from <font color="LEVEL">Devianne</font> of the Blackbird Clan.<br>
When Commander Burnstein <font color="LEVEL">opens the gate to go inside the Command Post</font>, Devianne uses her magic to hold it open. We've been thinking about <font color="LEVEL">pushing Burnstein into the corner</font> to make him go inside the Command Post.<br>
You should keep this in mind if you are thinking about going into the Command Post.<br>
