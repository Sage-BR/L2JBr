<html><body>Guildsman Morgan:<br>
I am Morgan of the Aden Commercial Guild. Our guild was created to unify traders throughout the kingdom in order to stem the influx of foreign Dwarven traders. We protect the rights and privileges of legitimate, honorable traders from the corrupt bureaucrats of the Dwarven Guild. Of course, there is also quite a benefit from the interactions and connections between the traders. But honestly, Dwarves are such natural traders that all of these protections are probably unnecessary.<br>
