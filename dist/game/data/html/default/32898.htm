Look at these beautiful buildings! They're fantastic! How'd our ancestors build these things? Amazing! Our <font color="LEVEL">Gray Pillar</font> guild is trying to find more relics of our ancestors' superior technologies.<br>
From what we've seen so far, it appears that the Ancient City Arcan was created by Elves, Dwarves, and the chosen of God. According to some current theories, our ancestor's filled the building with warmth and life by using <font color="LEVEL">Glimmer</font>. Glimmer is abundant here, but quantitative validity research is still underway!<br>
