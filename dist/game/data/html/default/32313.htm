<html><body>Deltuva:<br>
Welcome, traveler! I am assuming that since you know this place you must have heard about me from someone. I am here to help adventurers secretly enter the Steel Citadel. Unless you are already familiar with the Steel Citadel, however, I cannot permit you to go inside. It is simply too dangerous for the inexperienced. So, then...what would you like to do?<br>
