This is the Forest of the Dead, a dwelling place for restless souls who died violent or sudden deaths. As a Dark Wizard, I found this place to be a fertile area for my studies. Injustice, resentment, death, hatred -- all the ingredients necessary for the Dark Arts are plentiful here.<br>
If you wander around here, you may even encounter some of my puppets. Be warned! They are quite dangerous, and you would be well advised to avoid them.<br>
