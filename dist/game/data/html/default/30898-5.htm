<font color="LEVEL">Augmenting</font> means giving energy to weapons or accessories. To augment, <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> were needed, but they can no longer be found.<br>
Don't worry, though. I heard that they found a more powerful stone. It's called the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone</font>.<br>
If you have some <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> left, you can still <font color="LEVEL">augment items</font>. I can also exchange those Life Stones for <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font>.<br>
Just tell me what you need.<br>
