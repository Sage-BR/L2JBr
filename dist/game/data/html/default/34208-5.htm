The Black Anvil guild has always produced fine craftsmen. I, of course, am one of them. I will augment your item with great care.<br>
Did you hear that <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones can no longer be found</font>? The good thing is that a more powerful stone has been found. It's called the <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stone</font>.<br>
If you have some <font color="LEVEL">Life Stones</font> left, you can still <font color="LEVEL">augment items</font>. I can also exchange those Life Stones for <font color="LEVEL">Spirit Stones</font>.<br>
