The Blackbird Talisman is just one of the perks we give to those who have helped us out with our affairs! It can be made as well as upgraded! However, the materials aren't for free.<br>
So... anyone who wants it needs to get busy looking for materials. But did you know that if you carry out our quests diligently, you will be able to gain the necessary ones?! That's right, get busy! Hahaha!<br>
