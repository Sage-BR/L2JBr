<html><body>Collector Marsha:<br>
My older brother Trumpin is also a collector. He is very diligent and capable, although he does have a weakness for games of chance. I have watched him gamble away all his savings.<br>Actually I saw him not too long ago. We were running away from monster eyes and became separated. He must still be somewhere in this crater...<br>
