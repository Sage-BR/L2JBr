The <font color="LEVEL">Command Post</font> is the place where Kelbim's right-hand man, Commander Burnstein, is training the new recruits.<br>
From what I've heard, they are conducting terrible experiments inside. The Aden Vanguard has been investigating inside, so I'm sure we'll find out more soon.<br>
The gate to the Command Post is closed most of the time. The only time it opens <font color="LEVEL">is when Burstein tries to go inside the Command Post</font>.<br>
That's when <font color="LEVEL">Devianne</font>, who is near the entrance to the <font color="LEVEL">Command Post</font> will use her magic to hold the gate open.<br>
This is as far as we've figured out.<br>
