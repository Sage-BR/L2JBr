Asking around about the Anglers Fishing Rod, you're quite the fishing nut now, you are.<br>
It's only fair that with all the hard work you're doing for the sake of the Fishing Guild, you end up with a better fishing rod, isn't it?<br>
So, if you have a Sturdy Fishing Rod to start with, and you build up enough skill to satisfy our standards at the Fishing Guild, we'll modify your fishing rod using our special techniques to make it better. We can also make simple improvements so that the performance increases without making big changes.<br>
Of course, you're still not quite there yet in terms of skill. Please retum after building some more skill. Hmm.. let's say Faction level 2. That should do it.<br>
