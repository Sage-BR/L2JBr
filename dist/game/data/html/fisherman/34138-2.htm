If you want an Master Fishing Rod made, what's most important is to have a <font color="LEVEL">Sturdy Fishing Rod</font>. See, a fishing rod needs to be as sturdy as possible in order to withstand the modifications we're going to make to it.<br>
When you find a Sturdy Fishing Rod, along with <font color="LEVEL">Santiago's Reel Fragment</font> and the additional fees necessary, come and find me. I'll make sure your fishing rod tums out exceptionally well.<br>
Like I told you before, you can also <font color="LEVEL">improve the performance</font> of your rod, so investigate thoroughly. To improve your fishing rod's performance, you will need your <font color="LEVEL">Master Fishing Rod, Sturdy Fishing Rod, Santiago's Reel Fragment</font>, and some other things.<br>
