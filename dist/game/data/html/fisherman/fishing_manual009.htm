Bring the fish you catch to us to exchange for various items that the Fishing Guild deals in.<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Ugly Fish</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Nimble Fish</font> can be exchanged for <font color="LEVEL">Fish Stew</font>, Appearance Stones, Hair Accessories, Transformation Scrolls, and Weapon Appearance Stones.<br>
If you have caught a <font color="LEVEL">Powerful Fish</font>, it may be exchanged for a <font color="LEVEL">Stardust item</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Elcyum Powder</font> which is needed when exchanging for a Zodiac Agathion Treasure Chest. You may also <font color="LEVEL">sell</font> the <font color="LEVEL">fish to the shop</font>.<br>
If you bring us Elcyum Powder, we can let you in on a few secret techniques that have been handed down in our guild through the generation. Please think carefully about what you want to do with the fish that you catch.<br>
