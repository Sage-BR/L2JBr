Welcome. Want to learn how to fish, do you? You must have really been running out of things to learn to come all the way here to learn about fishing, of all things. Frankly, you'd be doing yourself more good by learning how to mine ore in the mines over there. Anyways, since you're here, really, there's no better way to spend an afternoon than casting the line!<br>
