<html><body>Fishing Manual:<br>
Created by the Black Anvil Guild at the request of Ampitri, the founder of the Fishing Guild, Fishing Shots are variations of Soulshots made for fishing.<br>
But while Soulshots amplify a hit, Fishing Shots increase the fisher's <font color="LEVEL">chances of catching a fish</font>.<br>
It's an item that will help you catch fish more efficiently.<br>
