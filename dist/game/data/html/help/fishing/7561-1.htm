<html><body>Fishing Manual:<br>
In order to fish, you need to find a fishing area. Once you arrive at the right spot, you'll see the button on the right side of your screen that alerts you that you can fish. <br>
Then check if you can actually fish. Check that you have a <font color="LEVEL">Fishing Rod</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Bait</font> equipped. You can set the Fishing Shots to be used automatically when you fish.<br>
