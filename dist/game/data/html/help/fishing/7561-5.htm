You can sell the fish whole, take it apart to sell a portion, or use it to craft items. You can also exchange it for Elcyum Powder through our Fishing Guild.<br>
Keep in mind that you might lose everything when cutting up your fish though! It depends on your luck.<br>
You can also bring Elcyum Powder to our guild to learn some legendary fishing skills. You decide what to do with your fish.<br>
