This system creates a win-win situation by forming a mentee-mentor relationship between a low level character and a high level character.<br>
Only characters of Lv. 85 or higher who have gone through awakening or the 3rd liberation can become mentors. But any character can become a mentee as long as they are Lv. 84 or lower.<br>
If you are qualified to become a mentor, you can search for your mentee candidates on the mentoring screen.<br>
