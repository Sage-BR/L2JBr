A mentor can apply strong buffs to his mentee.<br>
However, if the mentor and the mentee are too far apart, it will be difficult to apply this skill. To resolve this issue, the mentee has a skill to summon the mentor.<br>
Please refer to the clan / hero / mentoring skill categories in the skill window.<br>
