If you are qualified to be a mentor, find a character to become your mentee. Then, press the [+] button under Friend Manager/Mentoring and enter the name of the character that you wish to make your mentee. When the other party consents, you have a mentee.<br>
You can become a mentee yourself if you are level 84 or lower or have not gone through awakening or the 3rd liberation.<br>
If you are not satisfied by your mentor or mentee, you can end the mentor/mentee relationship. Select the appropriate target in the Friend Manager/Mentoring and press the [-] button.<br>
