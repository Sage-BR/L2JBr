Hardin's Academy is not to be trifled with. I hope you know what kind of people Necromancers are? They see human flesh and blood as an ingredient for their goals. Their apathy toward death is truly disturbing.<br>
Does this bother you? I can help you get away, if you want, far, far away from here.<br>
(If your <font color="LEVEL">Main Class</font> is Lv. 99 or below, you can teleport for free.)<br>
