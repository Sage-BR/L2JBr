This is the pier for Gludio Airships. Airships headed for the continent of Gracia also arrive and depart from here.<br>
We tap into a strong aura of power and depend on favorable winds to allow the Airships to travel such a far distance.<br>
If you're not ready to leave for Gracia yet, you'd best go back.<br>
(If your <font color="LEVEL">Main Class</font> is Lv. 99 or below, you can teleport for free.)<br>
