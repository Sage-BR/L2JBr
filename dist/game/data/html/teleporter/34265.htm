<html><body>Dimensional Researcher Lias:<br>
A Dimensional Rift has occurred here. I'm Lias, and sensing something strange about the Dimensional Rift here, I've come to research it.<br>
They say this area used to be called the Catacomb of the Witch. However, it's a completely different place now, and you'd best not let down your guard.<br>
Collect <font color="LEVEL">10</font> of the <font color="LEVEL">Superior Giant's Codex Fragments</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Rune Stone Fragments</font> that you receive after participating in the operation. They can be <font color="LEVEL">exchanged for the Superior Giant's Codex and Rune Stones</font>, respectively, so tell me when you're ready.<br>
Also, if you want to leave this horrifying place, tell me. I'll let you out.<br>
