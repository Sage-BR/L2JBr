<html><body>Gatekeeper Tatiana:<br>
Well, hello there. Would you like to teleport? I'm a gatekeeper, master of time and space. I might look idle, but it takes long years of hard work and training at the Ivory Tower to have this skill! We need some more appreciation.<br>
So, what do you need?<br>
(If your <font color="LEVEL">Main Class</font> is Lv. 99 or below, you can teleport for free.)<br>
