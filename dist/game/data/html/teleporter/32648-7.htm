<html><body>Update Announcer:<br>
Recommended for adventurers who are <font color="LEVEL">level 78 or higher</font>, the monsters on the Primeval Isle are weaker than they used to be since all the ancient HP was drained.<br>
The Crokians in the Primeval Plains are so reduced that a small group of adventurers should be able to defeat them. Even the monsters in the Lost Nest are smaller in number and weaker in strength that they were.<br>
It's also now possible to teleport from Rune Township directly to the Primeval Isle Wharf. Once on the island, <font color="LEVEL">Vervato</font> can teleport you from Primeval Isle directly to Rune Township.<br>
One last rumor: some people were spotted walking with a Deinonychus on the island. How and why they could do that remains a mystery...<br>
