Well hello there! Don't mind me, I'm just standing around just in case you're bleeding out from a monster bite and need to be teleported to safety. Or miss home terribly. Or need to go help a dying friend. Or really miss seeing the sea.<br>
That said, do you need to get somewhere?<br>
(If your <font color="LEVEL">Main Class</font> is Lv. 99 or below, you can teleport for free.)<br>
