The Airship is where Airships heading to and from <font color="LEVEL">Gracia</font> dock. However, Airship Fields and sea routes are all closed beacause the Gracia Continent is at war with Embryo. You can't go to Gracia through the Airship Field and Sayunes. If you want to go Gracia, ask me to teleport you to the Keucereus Alliance Base.<br>
But if you want to go the Airship Field, I can teleport you there instead.<br>
