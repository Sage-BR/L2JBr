<html><body>Gatekeeper Astiel:<br>
Welcome. I'm Astiel, and I've been dispatched here from the Ivory Tower. When I first arrived, the Ertheia were in such disarray, but the village has since stabilized.<br>
Now, what can I help you with?<br>
(If your <font color="LEVEL">Main Class</font> is Lv. 99 or below, you can teleport for free.)<br>
