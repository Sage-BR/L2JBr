<html><body>Hierarch Kekropus:<br>
Welcome. I am Kamael Hierarch Kekropus.<br>
I am the only one who lived the same age as the Giants, was made by the Giants, and has witnessed the entire history of the Kamael.<br>
Until now, I was watching the situation on the continent. What would one as old as I do on the front lines? However, I could not stand by and watch while the resurrected Giants destroy us and create a continent for themselves. Hence I have taken action.<br>
