Here in Gludio there is an <font color="LEVEL">Airship Dock</font> for Airships heading to Gracia.<br>
Gracia is surrounded by a powerful magic force field, so it's impossible to enter it via teleportation or by sea. Only Airships made in Gracia are able to safely travel between the two continents.<br>
A dock made from floating stones was constructed nearby; it took years of work, believe me. Boarding is conducted through the <font color="LEVEL">Airship Controller</font>.<br>
The only way to journey to the Gracia Continent is to use this dock. If you wish, I can teleport you there now.<br>
