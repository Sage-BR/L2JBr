The 1st basement floor, the top floor of the basement here, is full of powerful monsters. In the middle is a huge door which cannot be opened using normal means. I'm new here, so I don't know the details, but apparently some kind of special skill is required.<br>
But then, if you think you have what it takes, I won't stop you from going.<br>
