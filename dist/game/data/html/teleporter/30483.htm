<html><body>Ivory Tower Wizard Carsus:<br>
My name is Carsus, and I am an investigator dispatched from Ivory Tower. We've finished our work at the upper layer of the tower, and are ready to move onto the lower layer.<br>
We're <font color="LEVEL">installing an elevator to the 3rd basement floor</font>. Up to this point, we've used magic, but it's an unpredictable system at best, so an elevator seemed much safer.<br>
On the 1st basement floor, you will see a raid boss that controls the entire Cruma Tower. You can go there through <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower Wizard Ian</font> who you can find in a remote area of the 2nd basement floor.<br>
