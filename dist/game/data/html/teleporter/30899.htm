Leaving? I hope you enjoyed your stay.<br>
I don't see why anyone would want to leave, though. Innadril is the most beautiful city in Aden. Have you seen the ships crossing the canals at sunset? Have you heard the whisper of the reeds in the wind? If not, you're missing out.<br>
(If your <font color="LEVEL">Main Class</font> is Lv. 99 or below, you can teleport for free.)<br>
