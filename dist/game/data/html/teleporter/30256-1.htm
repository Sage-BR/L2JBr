<html><body>Gatekeeper Bella:<br>
Embryo has launched an occupational war againts Gracia. All Airship Fields and Sayunes are closed due to the war. The Gracia Army has allied with the Aden Army and managed to defend the Keucereus Alliance Base, but the Embryo Army continues to attack it.<br>
If the Keucereus Alliance Base is in a defensive battle, I can send all warriors of level 95 or higher to the Keucereus Alliance Base.<br>
If the alliance has successfully defended or no battle with the Embryo army has occurred, I can teleport you to the base immediately. Teleportation cost 150,000 Adena.<br>
