Welcome!<br>
Adventurers should know how to equip themselves at any given moment. If it were like it was before, I could give away some freebies to help you out, but there are so many adventurers nowadays and I have to import the equipment from overseas, so...<br>
Well, the most important thing is to buy gear that suits your skills best.<br>
Take a look around and let me know if something catches your eye!<br>
