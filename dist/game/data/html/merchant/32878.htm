<html><body>Sparky:<br>
Look, look here. Doesn't it look cramped in here? Right outside is the blue, open sky, and I'm cooped up here like a chicken!<br>
I would escape this coop if I could, but then I can't with customers like you coming along... not that I'm saying you shouldn't come along! How would I get all my news otherwise?<br>
Ah well... lucky you. Wandering around like that...<br>
