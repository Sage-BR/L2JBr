<html><body>Spellbook Seller Anton:<br>
Welcome! This is Elmore's famous landmark, the Library of Sages. It contains more books than anywhere else in the entire kingdom.<br>
After I stopped selling spellbooks, I learned how to restore damaged spellbooks while researching books and magic.<br>
And luckily, I found a spell that could restore damaged spellbooks. It usees magic power to put the missing parts together. However, the magic is not refined yet. There is a risk of losing the spellbooks forever if they fail to tolerate magic power.<br>
If you are ready to take the risk, I can compine your damaged spellbooks and restore them.<br>
