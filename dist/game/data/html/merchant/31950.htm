You must have a good eye for quality, after all, you stopped in here. So many adventurers these days choose accessories based on appearance. Appearance! Piffle! If I just wanted something cute, I'd visit that Human woman's accessory shop over there. She's got piles of cute junk. Nothing but sparkles and shine. The first time you wear one of those things in battle or out in the rain, it'll just fall apart! Nothing but shoddy workmanship!<br>
