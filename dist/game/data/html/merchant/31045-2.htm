<font color="LEVEL">Dragon Valley</font> is an enormous canyon ruled by the dragons and drakes. The souls of those who resisted Antharas and fought against him turned into the undead there - they are bound there and left to await their end.<br>
The monsters become stronger as you get deeper into the valley, so you MUST proceed with caution!<br>
There has been some severe crust movement lately in the Dragon Valley, so the dragons and their hatchlings are frequently moving their nests. If you see a <font color="LEVEL">Shiny Dragon Herd</font> during an earthquake, be sure to grab hold! The dragons carry gold and valuables in their bodies when they move their nest - if you are lucky, you might be able to obtain some rare items!<br><br>
