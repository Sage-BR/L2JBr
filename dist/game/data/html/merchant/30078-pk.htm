<html><body>Grocer Pano<br>
In a troubled world like this, perhaps it's those who fight with weapons who make the rules. But when peace comes, and it is time to construct a new world, those who only know how to fight will have nothing to do. The world will need people who know the laws. Remember my words well, my friend, and keep your heart open to peace.
