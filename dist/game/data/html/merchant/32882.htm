Hm? You are...! Oh, no you're not. I've been waiting to meet someone new, but you look familiar. Someone new would help me create something new...<br>
You don't get it? If I don't meet someone new, I can't have a new conversation! And if I don't have a new conversation, I can't have any new ideas! And if I can't think up new ideas, I can't create something new! Something new, yes...something new...<br>
Huh, what? I must have been mumbling. What do you want? <br>
