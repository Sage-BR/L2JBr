<html><body>Accessory Artisan Denign:<br>
I you compine <font color="LEVEL">Freya, Queen Ant, Orfen, Antharas and Valakas Accessories</font> with <font color="LEVEL">each soul</font>, you can get much stronger power. But if you do this, the old accessory will disappear and you'll get a new one.<br>
And Ring of the Beginning can be upgraded to a stronger item or <font color="LEVEL">Helios, Ramona, Mimir, Core and Harnak's Accessories can be condensed</font> into <font color="LEVEL">Source of the Emperor</font> which is used to upgrade Ring of the Beginning.<br>
However, when you receive a new accessory <font color="LEVEL">Enhancement or Enhancement</font> will be lost. If you're fine with that, I'll turn it into a stronger accessory.<br>
