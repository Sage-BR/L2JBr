Welcome! Welcome to our shop, filled with 100 years of tradition. We have all the weapons any adventurer could ever need, so please take your time and have a look around. Just so you know, I've heard that undead monsters have been more frequently spotted in the ruins after the war with Gracia, so I'd suggest buying weapons capable of dealing with them.<br>
