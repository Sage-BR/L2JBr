Only pain and terror await those who venture beyond the door of death. Are you so foolish young adventurer? If your heart is set on experiencing the banquet of pain that awaits, then I suggest that you have a look at the items I have for sale. Though they will not prevent your certain demise, you might find they delay your departure from this world.<br>
