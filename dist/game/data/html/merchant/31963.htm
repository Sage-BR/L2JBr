Nice to meet you! I'm Mineral Trader Hitchi.<br>
I'm not bragging, but our family has operated a mineral trading business for 4 generations. When the train was still working, people came from the ends of Aden to buy from us. Business is a little slower now, but the quality of our minerals is just as good! Now then, how may I serve you today?<br>
