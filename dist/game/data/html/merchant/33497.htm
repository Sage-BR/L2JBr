<html><body>Mysterious Dye Merchant Leuna:<br>
Hello, hello, hello! Welcome to Leuna's dye emporium!<br>
If it's a color, I've got a dye for it! Are you in the market for a good symbol dye? You can't do better than these babies! Nothing but quality! Though, there is one catch... <font color="LEVEL">When you purchase from me, you purchase a random dye.</font><br>
I'll reach into my dye box and pull out bottle... depending on lady luck, I may pull out a bottle or ordinary dye--good quality mind you, but ordinary. Or, I might pull out a bottle of exotic rare dye. What ever I grab, that's what you get.<br>
So, are you feeling lucky today?<br>
