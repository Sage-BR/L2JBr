<html><body>Mysterious Dye Merchant Raminya:<br>
Hey you, adventurer! Yes, I mean you.<br>
Perhaps are you looking for good quality dyes that can be used to dye symbols? I have plenty. The only catch is, <font color="LEVEL">if you purchase one, it will be randomly chosen from my selection.</font><br>
No picking and choosing. If you're in luck, you'll get an incredible deal on a very rare dye. If you're not so lucky, you'll get an average deal on an ordinary dye. Willing to risk it?<br>
What do you say? Feeling lucky today?<br>
