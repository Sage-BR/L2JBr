<html><body>Blueprint Seller Shaling:<br>
Welcome! I'm Shaling. I used to sell blueprints, but my real dream is to become an adventurer someday! First, I'll explore Cruma Tower! What? You're an adventurer? Oh!<br>
I used to sell blueprints, but since those technologies became public there's no need for them anymore. Oh, how I wish I could leave here and have a real adventure!<br>
