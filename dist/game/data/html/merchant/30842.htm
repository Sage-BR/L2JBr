Are you looking for something special? Hmm? An exquisite ring for your lover, perhaps? Or a delicate necklace for your elderly mother...?<br>
Come in, look around. Everything in the store is painstakingly crafted by Elven artisans. To the untrained eye, they may appear similar to items that some of those other traders have on hand, but the quality... I assure you, you'll never find quality like this outside of these walls. Those other sellers, they sell throwaway items. Our goods are all heirloom quality. You'll be able to hand these down to your children's children.<br>
