What brings you here, my young friend? What are you looking for?<br>
No, no, I'm not talking about items.... What I mean is, what did you expect to find all the way out here?<br>
Pshaw, never mind. Old habits die hard, indeed.... Don't think that I'm a senile old man. Wait, I might be senile, after all... But be that as it may, all items here are good and proper.<br>
