My master's blessings to all who have accepted the challenge! Now, please listen to the following rules. When you enter the arena, your names will be "Challenger". Aside from a few exceptions, standard rules will apply.
<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Note:</font><br>
1. When the match ends, you will be teleported to your point of entry.<br>
2. If you leave the arena before the match ends, you will be teleported to the Town of Rune.<br>
3. If the server goes down during a match, you will be teleported to the Town of Rune. If the server goes down during the registration period, the match for that time frame will not take place.<br>
4. If you cancel registration 30 times or more within one cycle or forfeit after entering the arena, you will no longer be eligible to participate for the remainder of the cycle. This includes cases in which you did not forfeit, but were barred from entering the arena due to insufficient qualifications.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Match Procedures:</font><br>
1. Each match will last 5 minutes<br>
2. The match will begin 60 seconds after entering the arena. You cannot move or see other challengers until the match begins.<br>
3. A Mysterious Guard may enter during the match.<br>
4. Invisibility will be cancelled after the 1st and 3rd minute into the match.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Winner</font><br>
1. You win if you're the last challenger remaining.<br>
2. If there is more than one challenger remaining at the end of the match, the one with the highest number of kills will be the winner.<br>
3. Otherwise, it will be a tie.<br>
4. If only one challenger enters the arena, and the Mysterious Guard does not appear, the challenger will automatically become the winner.<br><br>
<font color="LEVEL">Rewards:</font><br><br>
1. Once the winner is decided, up to 5 Mysterious Boxes will appear at random with your reward.<br>
2. Losers will receive Mark of Battles when leaving the arena.<br>
Good luck, all of you!
