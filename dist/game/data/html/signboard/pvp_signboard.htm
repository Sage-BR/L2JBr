Welcome to the <font color="LEVEL">Dueling Area</font>.<br>
Fighting and killing does not lead to chaos here. Death does not cause forfeiture of experience points or items. You may fight, kill and die as you please.<br>
The area outside the fence is a <font color="LEVEL">Peaceful Zone</font> where violence is not tolerated.<br>
*Warning: If a chaotic character whose PK count is 6 or higher dies in a dueling arena, he/she has a chance of dropping an item.
