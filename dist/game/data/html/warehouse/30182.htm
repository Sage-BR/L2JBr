<html><body>Warehouse Keeper Cliff:<br>
Oh, welcome, welcome! Isn't that heavy? Come rest for a moment!<br>
This warehouse is run by the Dwarf Banks Association! We are the most trusted association in all the world. The moment you deposit items here, and until you come to get it, CLINK! Locked away! You've heard all manner of stories, I'm sure, from wars to heartbreak to treachery and conspiracy, but have you ever heard of a Dwarven warehouse being robbed? No. No, you haven't.<br>
