Hello, Adventurer, and welcome to the Ivory Tower! I recommend you deposit your items and have a tour of the tower. You are in the 1st basement, home to various wizard and mage guilds. This tower is literally a village for the wizards, by the wizards.<br>
During the reign of the Elmoreden Empire, the influence of this place rivaled even that of the emperor...<br>
